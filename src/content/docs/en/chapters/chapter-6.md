title: "Chapter 6: T8-JRPG"
description: "Chapter 6"
---
Congrats on defeating The Godmother and unlocking Wishes! If you used a LRB to kill T8, stay in the LRB until you’ve obtained T8’s weapon. If you saved AP, buy Pink Heart / Faster Wishes.

## Wishes
- Wishes provide bonuses like Perks or Quirks, but level slowly with resources like NGUs
- Wishes require all 3 resources to make any progress, with wish speed proportional to (E PowerE AllocatedM PowerM AllocatedR3 PowerR3 Allocated)1/6
- Due to the 6th root, overinvesting resources into Wishes is not advised

Getting Started:
- Your first wish should be the kickass wish (Wish 0)
- Will allow you to farm T8 more effectively, also helps kill T8 upon rebirthing
- Then, complete Faster Wishes (Wish 1) - gives faster wish speed for everything else
- Finally, complete the Money Pit Wish (Wish 4) - unlocks new tiers past 1e50 gold
- Your first pit throw after completing will finish your Wandoos Money Pit level to 100
- Pit throws with more than 1e50 gold will now grant a 40% chance of a shockwave that increases item levels (20% chance for your current outfit, 20% for all daycare items)

After these first three, there are a lot more good wish choices to choose from. Wish priority lists will not indicate a specific order, but serve to distinguish important wishes to pay attention to.

Here are some general priorities to look for:
- If it’s cheap (fast) and gives a useful reward, it’s probably worth running
- E/M/R3 Generic wishes are never a bad option, also will help with wish speed
- R3/Hack Speed wishes are always useful before a Hackday

Here are some more specific wishes to look out for:
- Mega Buff is worth getting a bit before 8v2 as it’s an incredibly good move
- Titan Version Wish - gives better PP/EXP from harder Titan versions
    - Level 1 gives 10% for v2/v3/v4, Level 2 gives 20% for v3/v4, Level 3 gives 30% for v4
- Adventure wish can help you get to Typo faster
- Guff Drop Wish is the best way of improving guff drops, the earlier you get it the better
- Faster Wishes 2 is worth getting when it starts to become fast
- Active Quest Wish is great to get before Hackday

## E/M/R3 Ratios
- Keep E/M at 5/160k/4 until you can BB Beards for that resource, then switch to 4/150k/1
    - Switching ratio, you’ll have more bars than you need. Ignore bars, just focus pow/cap
- R3: 4/150k/1
    - [Ratio calculations (why 4/150k/1 is optimal) by postscripter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jfizTPWhP_qZGzY4cLjrjnfb4_CxW0pECrofe2vGyR0/edit)

## EXP Spending
- Buy only R3 until you complete HackDay 1 (HD1)
- Post-HD1, bring your E/M up to 3M Energy Power / 1M Magic Power, with Cap/Bars in ratio
- After 3M/1M, go back to only buying R3 until you complete Hack Day 2 (HD2)
- Post-HD2, bring E/M up to 6M/2M (double E/M from post-HD1)
- Then, focus everything into R3 until next chapter

- Optimal Order to buy R3 Speed/Bars: 10 Speed → 4 Bars → 12.5 Speed → 5 Bars → 16.7 Speed → 7 Bars → 25 Speed → 9 Bars → 50 Speed

## Hack Days (HD)
Hack Days are an approach to optimize Hacks by focusing on them for only one day every few weeks, wearing exclusively Hack items and using R3 Beta/Delta potions. Hack Days are significantly more efficient than running Hacks casually in 24 hour rebirths, as utilizing both R3 B/D pots (w/ Blue Heart maxed) will give you a 7.26x improvement in Hack Speed. Combined with a full Hack loadout, this allows you to gain a ton of Hack levels
- In Evil, Hack Days are done after you obtain certain sets of new R3/Hack gear
- The first HackDay is done after Typo snipe, CBlock 4, and having at least 50 R3 Power
- Utilizing Hack Days can make the game feel slower in the time before each Hack Day, especially if you compare to players that aren’t doing Hack Days and run Hacks casually. Each Hack Day provides a dramatic increase for almost every feature, which will propel you past any players that aren’t doing Hack Days that were passing you before because the Hack gains you obtained from doing Hack Days will surpass the levels they got casually.
- Hack Days require planning in Gear Optimizer to get the most out of each Hack Day
- See [Guide: Hackday Planning Guide](/ngu-guide/guides/hackday) for a guide on how to plan a Hack Day
- Note: Delta potions / Advance don’t work offline, so avoid going offline during Hack Days
- If you need to go offline, you should extend your Hack Days to utilize the full delta pot

## Perk Order
- (89) Better QP Rewards
- (90) Improved Quest Loot
- (104, 105, 106) Truly/Gooder/Another Gooder Idle Questing
- (95, 97) R3 Gens 1 (Pow/Cap)
- (94) Fib 89
- (74, 76, 77, 79) EM Gens 3 (Pow/Cap)
- (55) Adv Perk 1 until Typo/max
- (80, 81) NGU Generics
- (67) Another Guff Slot

## Quirk Order
Note: If you haven’t bought Extended Quest Bank (125k AP), it’s highly recommended to buy it for upcoming Hackdays. If you can’t afford it, you should start saving for the Evil → Normal NGU Quirk (15k QP) after defeating T8. If you have the Extended Quest Bank, just start saving Major Quests after defeating T8, you should aim to have a full bank of 50 Majors available after HD1.

- (14) Save for 15k QP Evil → Normal NGU Quirk based on the above note
- (8) Adv Quirk to ~400 or more to get to typo (but don’t ignore other quirks)
- (20, 30) Quirk Banks 1
- (53) Beasted Boosts 2
- (21, 31) Quirk Banks 2
- (8) Max Adv Quirk
- (47, 48) R3 Gens 1
- (22, 32) Quirk Banks 3
- (18) QP Acc Slot (get with post-HD2 QP)
- (72) Beasted Boosts 3
- (19) QP Guff slot 1
- (23, 24, 33, 34) Banks 4 and 5
- (13) Beast’s Fertilizer (can be useful QoL to rebirth at the same time daily)

## MacGuffin Priority Order
Adv > R3 Pow > R3 Cap > EPow > MPow > ECap > MCap > eNGU > mNGU   
After mNGU, the order becomes less rigid, but a rough order: Gold > DC > EBar > MBar > Aug > R3 Bar > Blood > Stat > EWandoos > MWandoos > Number

## Useful AP Purchases
(Not ordered for priority, just a list of useful purchases)

- Make sure to have 80k AP for R3 Beta/Delta potions for each HackDay
- Upon defeating T8, Pink Heart (175k) & Faster Wishes (250k)
- Extended Quest Bank (125k) - especially useful when used with HackDays
- Any Hearts aside from Brown/Purple/Rainbow that you don’t have yet
- Accessory Slots & Guff Slots are always good if you don’t know what else to get
- Faster Questing can be nice, but isn’t as useful as Extended Quest Bank
- Daycare Speed can be nice, and will become more useful later
- Beard Slot 6 is nice. Beard Slot 7 isn’t as necessary unless you have extra AP
- After the first Digger slot, any extras are mostly QoL. You never need more than 9 total
- After Typo, start saving 750k AP for T9

## FAQ
- How long should my rebirths be?
    - For the rest of the game (unless stated otherwise), you should be doing 24 hour rebirths. Aim to BB AT, Normal NGUs (unless running Evils), and Beards all rebirth.

- How should I allocate resources?
    - Pre-Typo: BB AT and Normal NGUs all rebirth (aside from when you run Evils), put excess E/M into wishes. For R3, split 50/50 between Hacks and Wishes.
    - Post-HD1: Aim to BB the first 5 Evil eNGUs and Ygg/EXP. Any excess E/M should be put into wishes, along with all of your R3. For the most part, you’ll be putting all your R3 into Wishes outside of Hackdays, then during Hackdays you’ll only focus Hacks.

- What loadout should I optimize for?
    - Entire Chapter: Lock Voodoo Doll until you can BB Beards all rebirth without it
    - Pre-Typo: Optimize for 3 Respawn, 2 Daycare, remaining Wishes
    - During Hackdays: Optimize only for Hacks
    - Post-HD: Optimize for 3 Respawn, 2 Daycare, 1-2 NGU, remaining Wishes
    - Whales w/ extra acc slots can run extra Respawn / Daycare accs as desired

- Why should I equip Daycare items?
    - After A5P/Emperor Looty, Pendants / Looties start to become very good. Using Daycare items helps you obtain future Pendants / Looties faster, which can be a major boost to progression. Running a few can be great, but running too many will slow down your Wishes / Hacks significantly. Find a good balance and figure out what works for you.

- When should I run Evil NGUs?
    - Pre-Typo: Evil NGUs are not that great. If you ran them in the T8 LRB, there’s a good chance you’ve milked them dry for now. Check GO to see if Evil NGUs are worth doing. At most, run them in the last 5-6 hours of your rebirth
    - Post-HD1: After getting the Evil → Normal NGU Quirk, you should be running Evil NGUs all the time. Evil NGUs should start to BB pretty quickly due to HackDay gains, Thro, and buying E/M again. Try to BB the first 5 eNGUs and NGU Ygg/EXP

- Which Hacks should I run before Hackday 1?
    - For the most part, just Adventure. You can run other useful Hacks (QP/PP/EXP) if you can reach a milestone within a few hours

- Typo wall is slow. Is there any way to make it faster? Can I LRB through it?
    - No

- Not even a super active way to progress faster?
    - You could rebirth every hour in the hopes of getting Money Pit shockwaves to level up Pendants / Looties. See this [Pit Run Guide by Deceptive Thinker](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTZSvoGsIWcqlQwVqlucTOxbkgj39J_NVY02o2yCfTqdjg8FVCxKhN_O-DCmmT8dhdoA4Bm5GTvix_z/pub)

- When should I do Hackdays?
    - The first Hackday is after sniping/obtaining one of each item from Typo. The order typically goes Typo Snipe → CBlock 4 → Hackday 1
    - The second Hackday is after sniping one of each item from JRPG. Your second Hackday should also be used to start your LRB to T9

- Why should I buy Extended Quest Bank?
    - Hackdays provide a massive increase in QP gain. If you save Major Quests to use after a Hackday, you will get much more QP than if you used the Majors before the Hackday.
    - Additionally, the timing for post-HD1 lines up nicely for when you want the ‘Beast NGU Quirk Ever’ (15k QP). Post-HD1, Majors provide around 300 QP, so 50 Majors * 300 QP provides just enough QP to purchase the desired Quirk.

- I’m doing Hack Day 1 and I don’t have enough Hack accessories. What should I do?
    - Fill in the remaining slots with Respawn. You won’t use Respawn in future HackDays, but for the first one it’s normal to have a few extra slots.

- How do I get R3 Guffs?
    - R3 Power drops from T8v1
    - R3 Cap drops from T8v2
    - R3 Bar drops from T8v3

- How much AP should I save for T9?
    - The recommended amount is 750k, so start saving early. It takes around 30 days to save up 750k AP, so it’s recommended to start saving after Typo.
    - However, if you’re short on AP, you can get away with 500k.

## Adventure Zones

### Post-T8: Typo Wall
- Welcome to the longest wall in the game! T8v1 to Typo takes about a month of 24h rebirths
- During this time, you want to start preparing for your first Hack Day by buying only R3
- You want to have at least 50 R3 power (with cap/bars in 4/150k/1 ratio) before HD1
- Nowadays, most people manage to reach 75-80 R3 Power for HD1
- T8v1 → (3 weeks) → v2 → (2 weeks) → Typo Snipe → CBlock 4 → Hack Day 1

### v2
- Suggested stats: 39 Quin / 15 Quin (39e18 / 15e18) P/T
- Neither drop is amazing, but still worth maxing before Typo
    - Cocktail is a new seed item and the best Wandoos speed item, useful for CBlock4
    - Violin case is a good EM Bar and R3 item, useful for HD1 and CBlock4

### Typo Zonw
- Snypo (Typo Snipe) suggested stats: 150 Quin / 68 Quin (150e18 / 68e18) P/T
- Congrats on making it to Typo! Your goal is to snipe until you have at least 1 of each item
    - Do I really need one of each item? Every item except the Chest is useful for CBlock/HD
- Why should I snypo before CBlock4? Typo gear is useful for CBlock4
    - Starting challenges will also reset your AT / Temp Beards / Banks, meaning you’d have to climb back up to Typo to get Typo gear for HD1

### CBlock 4
- After obtaining 1 of each Typo item, do a little bit of prep, then jump into CBlock 4
    - Prep Sheets from Discord players: [dcnairb](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/698513550460846111/1013910421528379392/cb4_guide_v2.png), [Thaunatas](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/698513550460846111/1014025603109892126/unknown.png), [goplayer7](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/698513550460846111/1013912977184919732/goplayer_cblock4.PNG)
- Challenge List (lists the final completion number for each challenge type):
    - Any challenges you missed from CBlock 3
    - NoRB 10 (only 8 are necessary to get T9’s timer down to 1 hour)
    - Troll 5
    - NoNGU 7
    - NoEQ 5
    - Blinds: As many as you want to do. They’re fast and the reward is great
    - 24H: As many as you want to do
    - NoTM: As many as you want to do
- The important challenges are Troll 5 and NoNGU 7, which provide Hack Speed for HD1
- Recommended Loadout: EM Bars are very important for this CBlock to get Magic Beards working ASAP. Wear your best Aug item (Meeple), your best Wandoos item (Cocktail), then as much EMPC while maintaining a 3 minute cap time.

![CBlock 4 Loadout](/cblock4gear.png)

### Hack Day 1
- The day has finally arrived! Plan out your Hackday using the [Guide: Hackday Planning Guide](/ngu-guide/guides/hackday)
- Is there anything else I should do first?
    - If you haven’t completed Troll 5 or NoNGU 7, it’s advised to complete those first
    - If you’re a few days away from A6P, it’s worth delaying for the Hack Speed boost
    - If you want to accelerate your A6P before Hackday, consider [Pit Runs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTZSvoGsIWcqlQwVqlucTOxbkgj39J_NVY02o2yCfTqdjg8FVCxKhN_O-DCmmT8dhdoA4Bm5GTvix_z/pub)

### Post-HD1
- Upon completing HD1, your next major objective is to reach T9v1
- T8v3 → Fad Snipe / Typo Max → JRPG snipe / Fad Max → T9 LRB / HD2 → T9v1
- Buy E/M up to 3M EPow / 1M MPow, with Cap/Bars in ratio
    - After finishing E/M, go back to buying R3. Your goal is to double R3 between each HD
- HD1 gains + E/M purchases should allow you to start BB’ing Evil NGUs in your rebirth
    - Aim to BB the first 5 Evil eNGUs and the first 2 Evil mNGUs all rebirth
    - If you cannot do this, add some NGU items to your loadout
    - Now that you can BB Evil NGUs, aim to get ‘The Beast NGU Quirk Ever’ ASAP
    - This will let you level both Normal and Evil NGUs, getting rid of any downsides to running Evil NGUs and letting you switch to running Evil NGUs all the time
- If you have the Extended Quest Bank, do a Quest Day immediately following the HD1
    - Quest Day is just doing all 50 of your Major quests ASAP. You can wear as much Quest Drops and Respawn gear during Quest Day to finish quests as quickly as possible
    - If you saved 50 Majors, this should give you the 15k QP needed for Beast NGU Quirk
- After Quest Day, resume your 24 hour rebirth cycle as normal, running Evil NGUs full time

### v3
- Suggested stats: 660 Quin / 350 Quin (660e18 / 350e18)
- Both drops are amazing, so worth trying to kill as soon as you can
    - Ring will be your best Drop Chance / Gold Drops item
    - Wand has great Wish Speed / Ygg Yield

### The Fad-lands
- Suggested snipe stats: 700 Quin / 400 Quin (700e18 / 400e18) P/T
- Fad gear is amazing (Boots good for Bars, Head/Chest/Legs good for Wishes)
    - Weapon is amazing and will be used until Early Sad
    - Krazy Bonez is good for Hacks and Quest Drops
    - Pokeyman Card is a sidegrade to 8v3 Ring
- After sniping Fad-lands gear, chill in ITOPOD until you can 2-3 shot Typo, then max Typo
- Don’t get the Dual Wield wish yet, it’s too expensive and you’ll only manage 1-2 levels before T9. Since each level gives 5% weapon effectiveness, the bonus is just not worth it

### JRPGVille
- Suggested snipe stats: 4 Sext / 2 Sext (4e21 / 2e21) P/T
- After sniping one of each JRPG gear, max Fad gear, then start HD2 / LRB to T9
- With max Fad gear, you can skip sniping the Legs/Boots/Weapon from JRPG if desired

### T9 LRB
- After JRPG snipe/Fad max, you’ll start your Long Rebirth to T9 with Hack Day 2
    - Reminder: [Guide: Hackday Planning Guide](/ngu-guide/guides/hackday). Planning should be similar to your HD1 plan, except you should have a full Hack loadout and you can add an hour of Wish Hack
- Start the LRB with using all 3 E/M/R3 Beta potions
- Post-HD2: Max Fad/JRPG sets, complete the [T9 Unlock Puzzle](/ngu-guide/spoilers/t9-puzzle), use all your Major Quests
    - Can get the 20k QP Accessory Slot with your post-HD2 QP
- Recommended Loadout priorities: Respawn / Daycare / NGU / Wishes
    - Many people choose to complete the AT wish during this time
- Keep NGU Adventure a BB’d all rebirth. BB NGU Adventure b for as long as possible

### T9v1
- Jetski defeated T9 with 25.3 Sext / 8.8 Sext (25.3e21 / 8.8e21) P/T without JRPG max
    - It’s possible at lower stats, but depends on how good you are at manually fighting
    - If you want to get better at manual fighting, T9 can be a great opportunity to practice
    - If you don’t, just wait until you have higher stats
- Rust defeated T9 with 15 Sext / 7 Sext (15e21 / 7e21) P/T without JRPG max
    - [Video: NGU Idle T9v1 1.5/0.7 (without JRPG Max)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPZl9v8gCTM)

Some manual fighting tips:
- Before the fight, use Parry / Charge in the Safe Zone, then wait until all skills are available
- Move into the T9 zone, start the fight with Mega Buff and Ultimate Attack
- Do as much damage as possible while Mega Buff is active
- While Mega Buff is active, use Hyper Regen / Heal before the Exile starts charging his buster arm. If done at the right time, they’ll be available right when you turn off Beast Mode
- Save your first Block of the fight to block the buster arm attack
- Play defensively. Try to keep one of Parry / Paralyze / Block available at all times
    - This will not always be possible
    - When using moves immediately when available, Paralyze / Block can last for 3 skills
- Use your second Charge on either Parry or Ultimate Attack when available, as these are your two highest damage skills
- When Mega Buff runs out, turn off Beast Mode and play very defensively until Mega Buff is available again. Then: Mega Buff, Paralyze, Beast Mode (on), Charge, Ultimate Attack
- Repeat this rotation until T9 is dead

Once you’ve killed The Exile, you’ve graduated from Chapter 6!
