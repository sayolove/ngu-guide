Welcome to Evil! Congrats on beating the tutorial, now it’s time for the real game to begin.

## Differences between Evil / Normal
- Attack/Defense is divided by 1 nonillion (1e30)
- Augmentations are slowed down by 2.5 trillion (2.5e12)
- Time Machine is slowed down by 1 trillion (1e12)
- Blood Magic is slowed down by 1 billion (1e9)
- For Wandoos in Evil, each OS requires 1 million (1e6) times the previous OS
- Evil Wandoos 98 has 1 trillion (1e12) times slower speed than Normal Wandoos 98
- In Normal, the difference between each OS was 1 thousand (1e3)
- When rebirthing, boss power bonus is based on 1.5^boss beaten, instead of 2^boss beaten
- Drop Chance for all adventure zones/titans is cube-rooted
- ITOPOD base PP per kill is increased from (200 + floor) to (700 + floor)
- All Normal adventure zones are unlocked when adventure is unlocked
- Evil adventure zones must be unlocked by defeating the corresponding boss in Evil
- There are new Evil Perks, Quirks, and NGUs

### Evil NGUs
- Evil unlocks a new set of NGUs (Evil NGUs), which provide a multiplier to Normal NGUs
- Evil NGUs are leveled separately from Normal NGUs, you can only level one at a time
- You can choose which to level using the Normal / Evil toggle in the top-right of NGU tab
- Since Evil NGUs provide a multiplier bonus to Normal NGUs, you should balance leveling both Normal and Evil NGUs for the highest bonus
- Once Normal NGUs reach BB, they are time-gated, nothing will improve their gains except the amount of time you run them since they’re already running at max speed
- Early levels in Evil NGUs can be very impactful, but overinvesting in Evil NGUs may be slower than building up your Normal NGUs and running Evils later when they’re faster
- A typical balance of Normal / Evil NGUs is to run Normal NGUs for most of your rebirth, then run Evil NGUs for the last hour to utilize maximum possible Beard Cage temp levels
- As you defeat T7 versions, run an extra hour of Evil NGUs per T7 version defeated

## Early Evil
Upon entering Evil, your first objective is to unlock T7. Unlike previous Titans, your main bottleneck for T7 is defeating bosses instead of adventure stats. Here are some key reasons:
- With FoK 24 and 6v4 accessories, adventure stats grow much faster from AT/NGUs/Beards
- Most players have the adv stats to kill T7 after unlocking, some people hit AK stats first
- Most A/D sources have been heavily nerfed in Evil, so they will require more resource allocation to be effective
- Evilverse/PPPL sets aren’t great, so instead of prioritizing adventure stats to farm these zones, you can just skip them to get T7 gear, which will be better than EV/PPPL gear
- TL;DR: EV exploder snipe → EV idle (accs) → PPPL exploder snipe → PPPL idle (accs) → T7

### Evil Entry
- After entering Evil, start a Basic challenge as soon as possible
    - Because you’ll need to climb up anyways, the first completion is just free
    - Don’t do more than 1, you don’t need the adventure stats, it’s more important to climb
- Do 30 minute rebirths at the start, utilizing Fruit Activation perks to climb bosses
- Repeat until you stop gaining 100x number gain per rebirth, usually up to Boss 60-80
- Beard Priority pre-T7: Fu > Golden > Reverse > Cage > BEARd > LadyBeard > Neck

After you’re done with 30 minute rebirths, switch back to 24 hour rebirths. 

### 24HR RB Schedule
Here’s a standard 24 hour rebirth schedule while you’re climbing up to Boss 125: (Credit to Pokie’s Early Evil Guide)

**0:00-0:30: TM Phase**
- Optimize for 2 respawn, lock Voodoo Doll, remaining slots in Time Machine
- Get as many levels in TM as you can within 30 minutes.
- Yes, it’s normal to only be able to get 0-2 levels early. Welcome to Evil.

**0:30-3:00: Augment Phase**
- Replace the weapon in the previous loadout with BDW gun
- Run your best augment until the 3 hour mark. Check [GO](https://gmiclotte.github.io/gear-optimizer/#/) to [find your best augment](/ngu-guide/en/guides/go-guide#augments)
- Put Magic into Blood: Run your best ritual <20m once and cast Counterfeit Gold, then run your best ritual for the remaining time and cast Blood Number. Use Blood Digger

**3:00-23:00: Normal NGU / AT Phase**
- Focus on BB’ing normal NGUs, while bringing AT up enough to accomplish goals
- Wear BDW Head while running AT
- Run Wandoos AT until cheap to run Wandoos 98
- First 24H RB: Get 100k AT Block levels, then AT Power until you have enough adv power to snipe EV exploder (5-7T pow) for GPS to run EXP digger for FoK harvest
- Next few RBs: Run AT P/T until you can idle EV for accessories only
- Once you have one of each, you can ignore EV until post-T7
- When you reach Boss 115/120, BB AT P/T for the entire rebirth to prep for T7
- In general, you can run AT with <40% of your Energy cap. Prioritize NGUs first
- Gear: Optimize for 2 respawn, Voodoo Doll, remaining on NGUs
    - Wear BDW Head while running AT

**23:00-24:00: Evil NGU Phase**
- Switch to Evil NGUs to take advantage of temp Beard Cage levels
- Focus NGU Augments and NGU Ygg/EXP to push towards T7

- Eat Fruit of Power A and turn on stat digger to push bosses at the end of each rebirth
- If you’re at Boss 124 at the end of a RB, you can spend all your FoK EXP on Rich Jerks
    - 100k → 1m can get you another boss to start the T7 Unlock Puzzle a day earlier
- Upon defeating Boss 125, make a backup save before starting the [T7 Unlock Puzzle](/ngu-guide/en/spoilers/t7-puzzle)

After you kill T7 and can reach Boss 125 within an hour, you’ve passed Early Evil!   
Buy Grey Heart and prep for CBlock 3. Post-CBlock, resume 24h RBs focusing Adventure stats
- Shorten the Augment Phase as needed to unlock 125 or your next adventure zone
- For Evil NGUs, use GO’s NGU tab to optimize gains, use a similar NGU priority to last chapter
    - Add an hour of Evil NGUs for each T7 version defeated. After v1, that means 2 hours

## Hacks
Hacks are essentially R3 NGUs, with a stacking multiplicative milestone every n levels
- Unlocking Hacks also unlocks your final resource: Resource 3 (R3)
    - R3’s name and color can be changed in the Settings
    - R3 is too expensive to put significant investment into. If the bar flickering is bothering you, buy up to 5.1 R3 speed and turn on Anti Fast Bar Flicker in Settings
- Post-T7, run A/D Hack until completing CBlock 3
- Post-CBlock3, run Adventure Hack. Focus Adv Hack as your default hack to push
    - After maxing Incriminating Evidence, get the first milestone on Hacks 3-7 (TM-mNGU)

## EXP Spending
- Pre-T7: Buy only Energy after you can consistently BB Normal NGU Ygg/EXP
- Post-T7: Balance ratios back to 3:1 Energy:Magic and 5:160k:4 Pow:Cap:Bars
- Don’t buy R3 aside from getting speed to 5.1 if the flickering bothers you

## Yggdrasil Order
- Early Evil: FoR 24 → Guff A 12 → Guff B 1 → Quirk 4 
- Mid-Late Evil: Melon 24 → Quirk 12 → Guff A 24 → Quirk 24 → Power D 24 → Guff B 24
- Melon 8 provides more seeds than Pom 24, start pooping Melon 8+

## MacGuffin Priority
