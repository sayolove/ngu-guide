Welcome to Sad. It’s time for guffs to finally get good.   
Note: If you’re playing on Kong, you’ll need to switch to Steam/Kartridge for Cooking/THE END

## CBlock
Your first priority is the entry CBlock: All Basic, NoAugs, 100LC, NoEquip, NoRB, and 2 Trolls

TC2 changes guff scaling to give peak efficiency up to 24h of a RB (from 30m). This drastically improves guff gains, especially when paired with muffs, which doubles guff bonuses for next 24h

## Post-CBlock
- Resume 24 hour rebirths, but now you’re looking to use muffs every other day
- Aim to get 2 usages of the muff with rebirths that are slightly shorter than 24 hours
    - The Beast’s Fertilizer and Five O’Clock Shadow reduces the timer for fruits/beards
    - With max fertilizer, all your T24 fruits will finish growing at 22:48 into your rebirth
- Before a rebirth, use a Muff, RB (1 proc), follow your normal RB for 23h, then RB (2nd proc)
    - This gives a limited time to get the 2nd proc, before 24 hours pass after muff activation
- Daily AP income is around 26-28k AP/day, this affords you a muff every 2 days sustainably

The meta path alternates between 23-24h muff rbs and LRB’s:
- 23h muff rbs from entry cblock to West World snipe
- LRB from WW snipe to T10v1
- Muff rbs from T10v1 to T10v2
- LRB from T10v2 to T11v1
    - Final CBlock post-T11, finish TC’s, Blinds, anything with rewards (skip NoTM/NoNGU)
- Muff rbs from T11v1 to T11v2
- LRB from T11v2 to T12v1
- Muff rbs from T12v1 to T12v2
    - Suggested to have at least 4.5k% adv guff for last LRB
- LRB from T12v2 to THE END

### EXP Spending
Spend EXP on Adventure Power in LRBs, E/M/R3 outside of LRBs

### Hackdays/Snugdays
Instead of set breakpoints for HDs, do a HD whenever you can get 1.3x adv gain
After a HD, do a Snugday (sNGU), using E/M beta/deltas with NGU gear to push sNGUs
Before first HD, it may be beneficial to run sNGUs for a few hours with NGU gear and E/M alphas to get some quick/cheap sNGU bonuses before diminishing returns kick in

### Perks
- Welcome to Sadistic difficulty (Perk 144, 500k PP)
- QP Tier (Perk 167, 800k PP) 
- Card Recycling: Card Spawn (Perk 216, 3M PP) 
- Adv Tier (Perk 172, 3M PP)

### Quirks
1. Improved Base ITOPOD PPP (Quirk 70, 40k QP) 
2. BIG CHONKER CARDS (Quirk 149, ~39k QP) 
3. Card Recycling: Mayo (Quirk 156, 40k QP) 
4. Wish Tier II (Quirk 114, 9k QP) 
5. PP Tier (Quirk 110, 20k QP) 
6. Adv Tier (Quirk 119, 39k QP) 
7. Beasted Boosts IV (Quirk 73, 90k QP)

## Card Tiers/Tags
It’s expected that you’ve been running hack/adv/wish tags up until now. It’s time to branch out.   
After obtaining the Card Recycling perks/quirks, start pushing for PP/QP/NGU Tiers:
- Start tagging/casting PP/QP cards at Tier 4
- Start tagging/casting NGU cards at Tier 8 (typically post-T10)
- Tag priority typically shifts from Hack/Adv/Wish → Adv/Wish/PP/QP → Adv/PP/QP/NGU
    - As you reach card limits below, keep Adv/PP/QP, rotate your last tag as desired
- Start yeeting meh cards if mayo is a concern
- If you have extra AP, use infusers like muffs. Infusers affect mayo fruit rewards

## Card Limits
You can stop casting these card types after they reach these % bonus values:
- Hack/Wish: 500%
- Drop Chance: 1000%
- NGU’s: 2500% (each)
- A/D: 100m%

## Chonkers
Buying the BIG CHONKER CARDS Quirk unlocks Chonker drops, cards with guaranteed max rarity (1.2x) costing between 21-29 mayo. Chonkers have a separate timer than regular cards.
- Cast any Chonkers that match the tags/bonuses that you would normally cast for cards
    - If you don’t have Card Recycling: Card Spawn perk, keep any Chonkers you don’t want until you’ve bought it, which advances the Chonker timer by 25% per yeeted Chonker

## E/M Hardcaps
- E/M Cap is hardcapped at 9e18 (9Q), stop buying at 3.5e12 (3.5T) cap
    - 3.5T cap gets to hardcap with duct tape, all cap wishes, perks 1-4, quirks 1-2, 2500 guff
    - You can stop buying E/M Bars whenever you reach a desired cap time for E/M
- E/M Power is hardcapped at 1e18 (1Q) pre-pots, stop buying at 4e8 (400M) pow
- For R3, you can stop buying R3 around 50k-60k power (cap in ratio)
    - R3 hardcaps are the same as E/M, but 50k-60k R3 is enough to finish all hacks/wishes

## Adventure Zones
Adapted from [Deceptive Thinker’s SAD strategy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14rsevmwHKHwwIfbKknc6yAjOlglOFXbw7qr6GhMNdnM/edit)

### T10
- Snipe BTS for gold, but skip farming BTS gear until T10 LRB
- LRB to T10 starting from WW snipe stats (2.65e27/830e24). Start with a Hackday
    - Spend all EXP on Adventure Stats > Power during the LRB
    - Focus PP/QP on Adventure Perks/Quirks
    - Can extend the LRB to max WW and getting a single secret drop to throw into daycare
- After maxing BTS gear and obtaining Corgi, do a Snugday
- Video of Rust killing T10v1:

- Cooking: Wear the GRB set while eating meals. The set doesn’t need to be maxed/boosted
- T10v2 wall is 2-3 weeks optimally with guff RBs
- Snipe Bread/70s mostly for gold, sets aren’t worth using until you can idle with BM
    - Breadverse/70s Idle stats (courtesy of dcnairb): 

| Breadverse Idle w/o BM                             | Breadverse Idle w/ BM                         |

### T11
- 2k adventure guff is a good point to start T11 LRB (~halfway between bread and 70s)
- Potions should let you BB sNGUs down to adv and exp with bread gear
    - Snugdays are no longer a thing, get the sNGU → eNGU quirk and run sNGUs full time
    - Your wishes will take a hit, but this is fine
- Don’t bother with Halloweenies until post-T11, extend LRB to max the set
    - Set bonus is ridiculously good, worth taking a few days to knock out
    - Halloweenies Idle stats (courtesy of dcnairb):

| Halloweenies Idle w/o BM                              | Halloweenies Idle w/ BM                          |
| :---------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------: |

- Max T11 set, then do a CBlock for any remaining challenges with rewards (blinds/trolls)
- T11v2 stats came around 3400 adv guff, around a full month after beating T11

### T12
- LRB took around a week each to T11v3 and T11v4, then 3 days to T12
    - 11v4 accessories are amazing
- Construction gear will be quickly outclassed by Duck / Nether, but useful for now
    - Still not worth sniping, wait until idle

- Duck / Nether are the real reasons for the T12 LRB, snipe as soon as possible
    - Gear will be used through the end of the game
    - T12 gear is trash, accessories are good. Weapon useful for sniping until Nether
    - Extend LRB to max Nether after T12

- Focus adv stats (Adv Tier, Perk 4-5, Quirk 4-5) and R3 for a final Hackday
- Continue guff RBs until around 4.5k adv guff optimally, then start the final LRB to THE END 
    - Can start the final LRB sooner if desired, final LRB will just take longer

### Tips for THE END
- If your QP gain is slow, consider wearing Quest Drops gear (Choffice Hat + Netherlands)
- Once you’re able to BB all blood rituals, blood gain is mostly just affected by blood guff %
- Run Wandoos XL in the final LRB for reaching Boss 300
    - If you’re unable to reach 300, consider rebirthing for the Number gain
    - Can also use pens on A/D chonkers to take advantage of the tier scaling
- At a certain point, Health Regen becomes more useful than Power/Toughness for T14 fight
    - If you reach 150 Decillion / 150e33 Power, stop buying Power and switch to HP Regen
