Ygg go brr

## Questing
- Manually complete the first three Major quests by accepting a quest, going to the zone, obtaining the necessary amount of quest items, and submitting the quest for QP
    - DC does not affect quest items, there is a separate Quest Drop Chance stat later
    - With the 300 QP, buy Baby’s First Quirk: Adventure for a 25% buff to adventure stats
- Uncheck ‘Use Major Quests’ and max out all the possible quest items for the quest item set bonus (+2% QP rewards per quest item maxed). Cancel minor quest after maxing item.
    - Maxed out quest items still only count as one quest item, don’t manual minors
- After maxing quest items, manual majors at the start of rebirths, then idle minors after
    - Manual majors at the start when you can’t farm PP at optimal floor yet
- Quirks: Baby Quirks, Beast’s Seed, Beasted Boosts 1, MPow/MCap 1, Gold, EPow/ECap 1

## Yggdrasil
- FoG 24 → Pom 24 → FoK 24 → FoL 24 → FoPa/FoA 24 → FoAP 24 → FoPb/FoN 24 → FoR 24
- Harvest fruits before FoL until they’ve been leveled to 12+, then start eating
- FoG should be harvested early for seeds, eat when your diggers are capped
- Poop Pom always, Poop these fruits as they max: FoK, FoL, FoAP, FoPb, FoN, FoR
- A big benchmark for this chapter is getting FoK 24, which scales with NGU Yggdrasil and NGU EXP, along with perks First Harvest, FoK sucks, and FoK still sucks. FoK becomes a large portion of your EXP gains, so getting levels in NGU Yggdrasil/EXP becomes a big focus

## EXP Spending
- Split EXP evenly into energy/magic (3:1 E:M base), using a pow:cap:bar ratio of 5:160k:4
- After T6v2, focus Magic to get up to a 2:1 E:M ratio
- After T6v4 accs and BB NGU Ygg/EXP, return to 3:1 E:M ratio, continue 3:1 into Evil

## NGU Priority
As you progress through this chapter, your NGU speed will start to get good enough to start getting some decent levels in NGUs like NGU Energy/Magic NGU, Adventure Beta, PP, and Respawn
- Use the [Gear Optimizer’s NGU tab](https://gmiclotte.github.io/gear-optimizer/#/ngus) ([Guide on How to use the GO NGU tab](/ngu-guide/guides/go-guide#ngus))
    - Set E/M cap, get E/M NGU Speed from Stat Breakdowns (divide by 100 for %), 60 mins
- In general, you want to prioritize gains in NGU E/M NGU, since it boosts NGU speed
- Example Priority: (if you meet % bonus change, put all E/M into that NGU for an hour)
    1. NGU E/M NGU with >1.05x
    2. NGU Adventure Beta/PP with >1.05x 
    3. NGU Respawn with <0.95x 
    4. NGU Gold/TM with >1.2x
    5. If none of the above, split Energy into Adv/DC, split Magic into Ygg/EXP

## Perk Order
First priority is to finish the Yggdrasil perks, max these in order:
- I Want Your Seeds ;)
- The First Harvest’s The Best
- Fruit of Knowledge sucks, 1/5
- Fruit of Knowledge STILL sucks, 1/5

After maxing ygg perks, finish any perks from previous chapters, then work through these until v2:
- Finish Boosted Boosts 1
- Finish Faster NGU Energy
- Generic Magic Power/Cap Perk 1 (split evenly)
- Faster NGU Magic
- Generic Energy Bar Perk 1
- A Digger Slot! (skip if you bought AP diggers)

After killing v2, switch to CBlock2 Prep:
- Stat Boost for Rich Jerks 1 (40 levels)
- Generic Magic Bar Perk 1 (get before prepping mBeards)
- Golden Showers (as many levels as possible before CBlock2)

Post-CBlock2: (get ICB before BB2 if gear is greened)
- Boosted Boosts II
- Improved Cube Boosting!

## Adventure Zones
Starting from Titan 6, Titans will have 4 versions: Easy (v1), Normal (v2), Hard (v3), Brutal (v4). This chapter mostly consists of beating T6 versions: v1 → v2 → CBlock 2 → v3 → v4 → Choco. Expect to spend at least a week between each version of T6, you should be settling into a regular rhythm of 24 hour rebirths focusing NGUs, Yggdrasil, and Beard growth.

- T6 LRB: Stay in LRB until T6 weapon drop and Baby Adv Quirk, then resume 24 hr rebirths
- Post-v1: Farm T6 gear and ITOPOD, NGU Adv/DC, Ygg/EXP, BEARd/Neckbeard until v2
- Post-v2: Get voodoo doll (v2) and Stealthiest (BAE) for NGU speed to prep for CBlock2
    - Stealthiest is a BAE chestplate that can only drop after the BAE set has been maxed
    - Max BAE at 1-shot power (7.2b or 7.2e9) and ~100k% DC, farm for 1 stealthiest
    - Consume your first purple liquid, turn on Beast Mode while farming in ITOPOD
    - Grants +40% power, but take 3x damage (50% power after purple liquid maxed)
    - CBlock 2 Prep: 150k PAWGs, split mNGU into Power B/TM, buy 10k% Rich Jerks A/D
- CBlock2: Finish all challenges aside from the last 5 NoTM and 24 H challenges
    - Laser Sword Challenges don’t reset your Number, so they can be done as a 24 hour rb
    - Suggested to complete when the entire challenge can be completed within 15 mins
- Post-CBlock2: Getting levels in Beasted Boosts, Boosted Boosts, ICB can help push to v3
- Max Stealthiest at max DC (500k%) - Can also use a Lucky Charm at 250k%
- Post-v3: Idle Choco World when you can for the accessory. More 24H rebirths to v4
- Post-v4: Power Pill and Small Gerbil from v4 will boost you to BB NGUs
- Choco World: Farm at 2-hit at 1.3t (1.3e12) power
    - Choco at Level 0 is worse than Slime set, so wait to farm until you can farm quickly
    - Maxing CW set will unlock E/M Bar Bar items, these items aren’t great, max passively
    - Maxing CW set will also unlock a new quest item in Choco World
