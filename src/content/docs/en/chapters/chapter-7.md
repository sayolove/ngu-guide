Congrats on defeating The Exile! *(Do NOT throw away the parts of the Exile)*

## New AK Mechanic
- For each version of T9, killing it 24 times will permanently unlock AK
- After killing T9v1 24 times, if T9v1 is unlocked, you can AK T9v1 without AK stats
- 24 kills can be obtained through any method (manual/idle/AK), tracked in Bestiary
- T9 LRB: Stay in the LRB until you’ve killed T9v1 24 times to unlock v1 perma-AK

## EXP/AP Spending
- If you saved 750k AP for T9 kill, buy the Rainbow Heart (Items) and the Tag Slot (Special 4)
- Double your E/M power to 6m/2m, buy power/cap in a base ratio of 4:150k
    - You want to switch your base ratio to 4:150k:1 after eBeard BB, but you already have more than enough bars from 5:160k:4, so just buy power/cap and ignore bars for now.
- After E/M, spend all remaining EXP on R3 in ratio 4:150k:1 until finishing the next Hackday

## Cards
To Yeet or not to Yeet?
- Tag Hack with your first tag slot, tag Adventure when you get a second tag slot
- In Evil, you’ll only be looking to cast Hack/Adv/Wish cards that have a Meh rarity or higher
- Mayo is the main bottleneck for card gains, as mayo production is very slow
- Adventure will always be kept tagged as you always need adventure stats
- Hack/Wish cards do not scale well with tiers, so their earlier tiers have better value
    - Other card types scale better with tiers, so it’s advised to wait until Sad/higher tiers

#### Frequently Cast Questions

- Why are card gains so slow?
    - Cards are very dependent on RNG, so the benefit from cards can be very volatile in the short-term. If you don’t draw any castable cards all day, then you didn’t get any benefit from cards that day, so it can be frustrating to track daily. However, they will become a consistent source of growth over time, so give them some time to grow.

- When do I start casting ‘x’ card type?
    - In Evil, you only want to cast Adv/Hack/Wish cards. Any other card type needs better tier upgrades to provide meaningful bonuses, but most tier upgrades are locked in Sad

- Which mayo should I run?
    - If you have a card waiting to be casted, run whichever mayo it needs. If not, run whichever mayo you have the least of.

- Should I buy the mayo fruit auto-activates?
    - No, they’re too expensive and provide tiny mayo progress. You’ll buy them in Sad.

## T9 Set Bonus (BEUC)
- Maxing the T9 set unlocks a secret drop from T9: ‘Sack of the Exile’ (AKA ‘Nuts’)
    - Nuts have a flat 2% DC from T9, not affected by DC modifiers
- Once you’ve gotten Nuts, assemble the parts of the Exile (+ Nuts) in the top-left of Page 1
    - Go back to the Sewers and ctrl+click the Nuts to unlock another secret drop: BEUC
    - BEUC has ¼ of the DC of T9v4 drops or 1/10th of the DC of T9v2 drops
    - DC is affected by DC modifiers. Equipping the Ring/Cursor in your main loadout can help with BEUC DC while being a minimal wish/ngu speed loss.
- Blue Eyes Ultimate Chestplate (BEUC) is an incredibly strong chest gear for Hacks/Wishes
    - Special Stats: Hack Speed (20-40%), R3 Cap (120-240%), and Wish Speed (25-50%)
- Both the Nuts and BEUC can take a long time to drop, expect each to take a few days
- You can double check that you have the drop unlocked by going to the Item List
    - Nuts, hovering over any T9 gear should show that the set bonus is complete
    - BEUC: hovering over Nuts: ‘SUPER SECRET EXILE DROP IS UNLOCKED’
- While waiting, you can start preparing for the upcoming CBlock/Hackdays:
    - For CBlock: A/D Milestone Reducers, Basic Training Quirk/Wish
    - For Hackday: R3 Generic Perks/Quirks/Wishes

## BEUCBlock
The Final CBlock
- After obtaining the BEUC, it’s recommended to jump right into the last Evil CBlock
- No prep required, you already have the stats. Start whenever you have 1-2 days free
- If you really want to prep, get Basic Training quirk/wish and A/D Hack Milestone reducer
- Challenge List: Finish all Trolls, NoNGUs, Blinds. Complete up to 5 24Hs and NoTMs
- After finishing BEUCBlock, start a [hackday](/ngu-guide/guides/hackday) (BEUCDay)

## Post-BEUC
- v2 → v3 → Rad Idle → RadDay → v4 → Sad
- After BEUCDay, it’s back to 24 hour rebirths for most of the rest of the chapter
    - Quadruple E/M power to 24m/8m, fixing your base ratio to 4:150k:1
    - Then only R3 until RadDay (Hackday 4)
    - Switch tags to Wish/Adv, continue casting meh+ Adv/Wish/Hack. Use 3rd tag on Hack
    - Since you just did a Hackday, Hacks will be slow. Focus Wishes in between Hackdays
- Try to push at least one boss per rebirth, you need to defeat Boss 300 to unlock Sad
- When you get a second BEUC drop, put in daycare to help get extra levels
- Ygg: Finish last non-mayo fruits, then level mayo fruits equally. Mayo output is very low.
- Diggers: Don’t forget them. You shouldn’t need to ever run Beard diggers again.

### Pendants and Looties
- As you approach A7P/Supreme Intelligence Looty (SIL), generally advised to upgrade asap
    - If you have a hackday coming up soon, a max A6P > Level 0 A7P for Hacks, keep A6P
    - However, if you can get a Level 0 A6P + Level 0 A7P, this is better than Max A6P
- SIL is advised to keep in daycare except for farming gear/titan drops (same for GDL)
- A7P is very good, worth equipping (same for A8P)

### Perks/Quirks/Wishes
Finish up any previous lists first. By this point, you should have a general understanding of what your priorities should be. If it’s cheap and seems useful, it’s probably worth it. These lists are not meant as strict ordered lists, but general guidelines and perks to look out for. If you have questions about specific perks or choices, ask the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/5revMxD)! There are plenty of helpful individuals that can offer advice and suggestions :unsmith:

#### Perks
- When your next objective is a Hackday, focus R3 Generics (Power/Cap)
- When better perks are too expensive, EMR3 Generics are always generally good
- Some expensive perks to prioritize: Wish Card Tier/Fib 987/Boosted Boosts 3 (any order)
    - All 3 will improve a timegated source of stats, so they’re valuable to get when feasible
- Start saving 500k pp for sad after RadDay

#### Quirks
- Acc Slot (20k) - Top Priority, typically obtained after emptying Quest bank after HD2
- When your next objective is a Hackday, focus R3 Generics (Power/Cap)
- When better quirks are too expensive, EMR3 Generics are always generally good
- Wish Card Tier (3k) is super cheap + good
- Tag Slot (20k) is great for getting more castable cards
- Guff Slot (7.5k) is pretty good
- BB3 provides an improvement to cube, which is a timegated adv stat source
- Buy Beard/AT Banks when fairly affordable
- BT Quirk (4k) is worth when reasonable for faster AT unlock
- A/D MS Reducer (4k) can help push to 300 if it wasn’t obtained for BEUCBlock
- Adv Card Tier (13k), Hack Card Tier (15k) are also great
- Beast’s Fertilizer can be useful QoL to adjust rebirth times to get more consistent 24H RB’s
- PP Milestone Reducer (21k) is worth getting towards the end of Evil
- Don’t buy the Wish Slot (50k) until Sad unless you have a surplus of QP
- Start saving 120k qp for sad around v3/rad

#### Wishes
- AT Wish - Top Priority, typically obtained in the T9 LRB 
- When your next objective is a Hackday, focus Hack Speed
- EMR3 Generics are essentially wish speed, so they are high priority
- When Dual Wielding is semi-cheap, it’s worth maxing
- By default, just run whatever’s cheap and still useful
    - Oh Shit isn’t worth getting

### AP Purchases
- Rainbow Heart + Tag Slot
- Any remaining heart except for Purple/Brown
- Acc Slots are always a good purchase (675k one isn’t worth rushing)
- Finishing Beard Slots will help push to 300 easier
- Guff Slots are always useful, and become more important in Sad
- ½ AutoBoost/AutoMerge Timer is very good QoL, ensuring your inventory won’t get filled completely by boosts, which could block drops
- Faster Questing is a nice daily QP increase
- Daycare Speed Boost is good for pendants/looties
- Mayo Generators provide negligible value to mayo speed, only good for QoL
    - It’s more efficient to buy multiple infusers than buying Mayo Generators

## Adventure Zones
- T9 LRB: Stay in LRB until 24 T9v1 kills for T9v1 AK. Resume 24h RB’s, max T9 set ASAP
    - T9 gear is very strong, giving great hack/wish bonuses. Head gives strong Gold Drops
- BEUCBlock / BEUCDay: see above sections, resume 24h RB’s after
- v2: Fight uses specials more often, new special reverses health regen (essentially a bleed)
    - Drops: Credit Card is good for gold and E/M bars, Tentacle is good for Hacks/R3 bars
    - Post-v2: v2 to v3 is the longest part of the chapter, expect around 3 weeks of 24h RB’s
- v3: Fight adds mind control (2s paralyze). Blocking during will block the entire paralyze time
    - Drops: Skip Card is great for Wish/NGUs, Antennae is great for Hacks
- Rad LRB: In the rebirth after your first v3 kill, use E/M/R3 beta pots and LRB until Rad max
    - Rad DC is very low, making sniping not worth the effort, so LRB gets to idle stats faster
    - If you do decide to snipe, put the Mixtape in daycare to get the Evil Acc set bonus
    - Stay in LRB until Rad max, then once gear is boosted, start RadDay (Hackday)
- Post-RadDay: Resume 24H rebirths, **spend all EXP on Adventure Power until v4**
    - Keep doing 24H rbs until you can reach Boss 290 and 50 sept (5e25) power, then LRB
- v4 LRB: Pop E/M/R3 betas and push to the End of Evil
    - v4 fight adds Life Drain, which makes the Exile deal 2x damage and heal itself 10%
    - Rust killing 9v4 way under recommended stats: [NGU Idle T9v4 1.56/0.83](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPZl9v8gCTM)
    - Drops: Black Lotus is a very strong wish item, Energy Buster is a very strong hack item

Once you’ve defeated Boss 300 and killed 9v4 24 times, it’s time to go Sadistic.
