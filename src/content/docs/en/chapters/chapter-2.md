description: "Chapter 2"
---

Congratulations on defeating your first Titan! Consume ‘A Number’, it’s time to unlock NGUs.

## NGU (Numbers Go Up)
- NGUs are permanent stat boosts that can be leveled with Energy/Magic (E/M)
- NGU levels are very expensive, costing a lot of E/M and time
    - All levels and progress persist between rebirths, so no progress is ever lost
    - NGUs will become a crucial feature later, when you have better E/M to afford levels
- For now, NGUs aren’t typically worth focusing while actively playing, but if you’re going to step away from the game for a few hours or go offline, NGUs are a great place to dump E/M into during that time to build up your permanent bonuses
    - Energy: Focus on NGU Power a and NGU Gold, which will help you most early
    - Magic: Focus NGU Yggdrasil, which will help you with the next feature you’ll unlock

## Augmentations / Time Machine Changes
- T1 (GRB) drops a significant amount more gold than enemies in previous adventure zones
    - T1’s base gold drop ranges from 1M to 1.25M gold, while HSB bosses range 64k-80k
- This dramatically increases the gold output that the Time Machine produces after T1 kill
    - Once you can kill T1 consistently, you can also start putting E/M into Time Machine at the beginning of rebirths to further boost your gold production you’ll get after the T1 kill
    - Leveling Time Machine Speed after Level 49 adds a new linear multiplier to gold production, which is very good for your gold production. Don’t stop at Level 49
- Capitalize on using this gold to start buying Augmentation upgrades, which provides a multiplier to the base value that augments give, but cost a lot more gold
    - Focus on Safety Scissors / Danger Scissors, with your new gold production, you can get Scissors to outscale the expensive augments you were using in Chapter 1
    - Keep running Scissors until you can start idling A Very Strange Place, when you should be able to transition to running only Milk Infusion / Drinking the Milk Too
- Wandoos is still very slow and not worth overinvesting into. 
    - Can be useful running for a few minutes at the end of a rebirth for a small push in bosses defeated, especially if you need to unlock a new adventure zone to farm.
    - Wandoos 98 formula provides constantly diminishing returns, so don’t focus heavily

## EXP Spending
Similarly to Chapter 1, your main focus is still buying Energy in a 1:37.5k:1 base P:C:B ratio
- Magic remains mostly unnecessary, aside from buying magic cap to afford Yggdrasil fruit unlocks as necessary (see below section on Yggdrasil for more information)

For most other one-time purchases, buy when their cost is less than 10% of your total EXP
- The daycare slot is generally not the best buy early, as the rate of daycare is very slow
- However, if you buy any Hearts, you should obtain the Daycare to level the hearts
- Auto-Merge starts with a 1 hour base cooldown, so it’s not as great as it sounds

## Items to Keep
Note: This is NOT an exhaustive list of good items or the only items to keep. These are just items obtainable in Chapter 2 that may come in handy in future chapters. Generally, any item with a unique special bonus (AT / wandoos / respawn / cooldown / NGUs) is likely worth keeping.
- Definitely Keep to next chapter (unique specials):
    - Sands of Time (cooldown)
    - King's Circle Amulet of Helping Random Stuff (AT/wandoos)
    - Stapler (respawn)
    - A Regular Tie (NGU/gold)
    - Ghost Typewriter (dc)
- Can be handy in the future:
    - Amulet of Sunshine, Sparkles and Gore (strong em pow)
    - Dragon Wings (gold/m cap)
- Can be useful now for specials, replace next chapter:
    - Office Shoes
    - Gaudy Shirt
    - Gaudy Pants
- Optional Magic Cap items for AutoPom: (wearing magic cap items can let you reach the cap required for Auto-Activate Pom without needing to buy 3M magic cap)
    - Giant Windup Gear
    - Magicite Crystal
    - Sinusoidal Wave
    - A Beanie
    - The Pen-Is

## Unlockable Mechanics

### Yggdrasil
After defeating T2 (GCT), consume ‘A Giant Seed’ to unlock Yggdrasil   
Yggdrasil allows you to grow fruits that you can eat for various benefits
- Fruits can be unlocked with seeds, obtained from ‘A Giant Seed’ or eating fruits
    - Consuming ‘A Giant Seed’ gives from 1-200 seeds, depending on the item’s level
    - Each level adds 1 seed and +1% bonus extra seeds, rounded down
- Fruits cost energy or magic to activate, subtracting the cost from your idle energy/magic, then regenerating back to your full cap
    - Once your Energy/Magic cap exceeds 10x of a fruit’s activation cost, you can buy that fruit’s Auto-Activate with EXP, which will automatically activate the fruit on rebirth or after eating/harvesting without any Energy/Magic cost.
    - Auto-Activate only activates fruits, nothing in the game auto-harvests fruits
- Fruits can be upgraded with more seeds. Each tier lets the fruit grow for another hour.
    - Fruits are strongest at higher tiers, so you should grow each fruit to the max tier
- Eating fruits gives a fruit-specific bonus and some seeds
- Harvesting fruits gives no fruit-specific bonus, but gives double the amount of seeds
- Poop is a consumable that increases eating/harvesting rewards by 50%
    - Poop can be bought with AP, a rare drop from Icarus Proudbottom in The Sky, or a drop from the ITOPOD after buying ‘What a Crappy Perk’
    - Maxing ‘A Giant Seed’ gives 10 Poop as a set bonus
- Seeds, fruits unlocked, and all upgrades are permanent. Fruit growth resets on RB

Strategy: Focus on seed income while maintaining short regular rebirths for boss EXP
- Level Order: FoG 2 → FoPa 1 → FoA 1 → Pom 1 → FoPa 2 → FoG 4 → Pom 3 → FoG 10
    - If you don’t have enough Magic Cap to unlock Pom, buy only Magic Cap to unlock Pom
- Match your rebirth duration with your highest tier fruit, starting out at 2 hours after FoG 2
    - Do 2 hour rebirths until you level FoG to 4, then do 4 hour rebirths while getting Pom 3
    - After Pom 3, push to FoG 10, extend your rebirth duration with your highest fruit level
- Harvest all fruits at the highest tier you can grow for maximum seed income
- Save Poop early, start using it on Pom from Level 6 onwards

### Gold Diggers
After defeating T3 (Jake), consume ‘A Scrap Piece of Paper’ to unlock Gold Diggers
- Gold Diggers provide various bonuses at the cost of constant gold drain from Time Machine
    - Diggers must first be unlocked by paying a one-time gold cost, and can be upgraded further with more expensive one-time gold costs
    - All unlocks/upgrades are permanent and persist through rebirths
    - Upgrading any digger also adds to a global digger bonus that affects all diggers
    - Always upgrade diggers, even if you aren’t going to actively use that digger
- It’s normal to not be able to afford any diggers for a few days after killing T3 (Jake)
- Early on, you will primarily be using the Drop Chance and Adventure diggers
    - Stat digger can be useful to kill a few extra bosses, but there’s no reason to keep it on

## Adventure Zones
All the adventure zones in this chapter are pretty close together in terms of power/toughness, to the point where you can always snipe (manually fighting the bosses of an adventure zone for gear) the next adventure zone before you’ve maxed out the current set. Because progress is bottlenecked by adventure stats, it can be much faster to obtain better gear and come back to max the other sets when you have better drop chance and enough power/toughness to kill enemies in one hit. Thus, the optimal strategy for this chapter is to snipe adventure zones whenever you can, then level/boost that gear set just enough to snipe the next adventure zone.
- You can trash old gear sets for the inventory space, you’ll farm them all faster later
- It’s recommended to at least defeat T3 (Jake) before going back to farm old zones, as the feature unlocked by T3 provides a strong drop chance modifier
- This method does require a lot more active play than just idling, so may not be for everyone
    - If you prefer not to snipe, you can always choose to idle/max each set as you go. While this approach is a bit slower, the difference shouldn’t be more than a few days.
- Gear sets generally alternate between Energy/Magic for their special boosts
    - For the most part, use whatever gear has stronger P/T to snipe the next zone
    - While leveling features before you can snipe, use Energy gear for stronger Energy

### Post-T1
After killing T1, keep doing 1 hour rebirths to farm T1 gear (4 gear, 1 weapon, 2 accs)
- Each Titan has their own respawn timer, which can be seen by hovering on Adventure
- T1 takes an hour to respawn, starting from the start of a rebirth or after being killed
- Rebirthing will not preserve your T1 timer, it resets to an hour from the start of a RB
- T1 gear is a very strong set, with good energy bonuses and strong p/t
    - Cooking is a useless filler special stat made to waste special boosts before you can start boosting the important stats

There is a decent gap between being able to kill T1 (~1400 p/t) to being able to snipe the first adventure zone in Chapter 2, Clock Dimension (~3250/2250 p/t)
- Optionally, if you’re an active player and want to knock out some challenges early, after farming a full set of T1 gear, you can complete 5 basic challenges and 1 24H challenge
    - Typically recommended for the end of this chapter (post-AVSP) when they’re faster
    - Basics take around 5-6 hours each here, around ~2 hours each at AVSP
    - Challenges require active play, you want to finish them ASAP. Use 15 minute RBs

### Clock Dimension
Unlocked by defeating Boss 66, drops Magic-focused gear set
- Clock weapon is very strong, but you can keep using T1 headpiece for a while

### T2 (Grand Corrupted Tree)
Unlocked by defeating Boss 66
- Suggested stats: 5k/4k P/T
- Spawn timer: 1 hour
- GCT can release 2 types of spores that debuff your power or toughness
- When you get the toughness debuff (“You feel the energy draining from you”), try to use Block or Defensive Buff to reduce the amount of damage you take during this time
- GCT does not drop a gear set, mostly dropping boosts from 10 to 100
- Rare drop: Mysterious Red Liquid (1% base drop chance) - enables Hyper Regen skill

### The 2D Universe
Unlocked by defeating Boss 74, drops Energy-focused gear set
Once you can kill enemies quickly, 2D becomes the next best boost zone after Sky
At 2D idle, focus all your boosts into the Infinity Cube until you reach Tier 1

### Ancient Battlefield
Unlocked by defeating Boss 82, set has both Energy and Magic

### T3 (Jake from Accounting)
Unlocked by defeating Boss 82
- Suggested stats: 14k/12k P/T
- Spawn timer: 2 hours
- Jake gradually disables most skills in a specific order, use skills before they’re gone
- Order: Ultimate Attack → Heal → Piercing Attack → Ultimate Buff → Strong Attack → Offensive Buff
- Jake has a rapid frenzy attack where he opens his mouth and releases locusts
- This attack hits 10 times with .15 seconds between each attack. Use Block during this
- Jake drops a full set of gear (4 gear, 1 weapon, 2 accessories)

### A Very Strange Place
Unlocked by defeating Boss 90, set has both Energy and Magic
- When trying to snipe AVSP, you’ll most likely use Ancient Battlefield’s Spoopy set to snipe
- While Jake’s Office gear is stronger, it’s faster to farm AB than wait 2 hours per Jake spawn, so Spoopy gear will level up faster than Office

### Micro CBlock
If you’ve already completed all 5 of your basic challenges earlier, skip this section
- Challenges reset your Number and effectively freezes progress until they’re complete.
    - To reduce the amount of time you spend stuck in or recovering from challenges, it’s best to do challenges in blocks (challenge block = “CBlock”) at points when your stats are high enough to complete them quickly.
- After obtaining some AVSP gear, defeating Boss 100, and starting T4’s unlock puzzle, it can be a good time to complete Micro-CBlock: 5 Basic Challenges and 1 24H Challenge
- During Micro-CBlock, you complete challenges quickly by focusing on features that push bosses and increase your Number, like Wandoos, Augmentations, Time Machine, and Blood Number. It’s suggested to do 15 minute rebirths to optimize number gain.
    - During your challenges, you can also be progressing the T4 unlock puzzle.

### LRB to Mega/T4
After defeating Boss 100, getting some AVSP gear, and finishing the Micro-CBlock, it can be a good time to do your first long rebirth (LRB)
- Long Rebirths are used as temporary spikes in adventure progress, utilizing Advanced Training and NGUs to get to a new Titan to unlock important features earlier
- This LRB is used to get from AVSP idle to farming Mega gear to defeating T4 multiple times
    - Aim for 2-3k levels in Advanced Training P/T and 250+ levels in NGU Adventure a
    - If you have an Energy Beta potion, this is a great time to use one
    - Stay in the LRB killing T4 until you’ve obtained the Rings of Energy and Utility
- Why is this a good time? After T3 AK, your primary source of EXP has changed from killing bosses to killing Titans. Since boss EXP was the biggest incentive for rebirthing often, this ends up being a perfect opportunity to make a strong push in adventure without having to reset Advanced Training levels every rebirth or waiting for E/M to fill.
    - After killing T4, there will be a new incentive to rebirth at a regular cadence again
    - LRBs should be used sparingly, you gain more permanent progress from regular rebirths than LRBs
- Note: There is an alternative strategy to LRB all the way to T5, dubbed the [Mega-T5 LRB](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HsX70QasNW_4G1FE-xBdCsvIaDvhA01N72qilXshpFc/edit)
    - This is probably a faster way to reach T5, but is less tested. Links to a separate guide

### Mega
Unlocked by defeating Boss 100
- Only has one boss, but boss has double chance of appearing
- Gear has good P/T but specials are worse than AVSP/Jake gear

### T4 (UUG, the Unmentionable)
Unlocked by defeating Boss 100
- Suggested stats: 400k/300k P/T
- Spawn timer: 2 hours
- Becomes invincible after his first attack with exponential power growth unless you solve a puzzle. Try fighting T4 in Adventure and read the battle log to start the puzzle
    - For spoilers, see [Secrets & Spoilers: T4 Unlock Puzzle](/en/spoilers/t4-puzzle)
- Doesn’t drop a set of gear, drops a set of 5 rings (accessories)

Once you’ve defeated T4, you’ve graduated from Chapter 2! You can proceed to [Chapter 3: T4-BAE](/en/chapters/chapter-3)
