The bonus calculation depends on the level of the MacGuffin (L), and the time factor (T):

| Before 30 minutes                      | At 30 minutes | After 30 minutes                         |
| :------------------------------------: | :-----------: | :--------------------------------------: |

Most MacGuffins reach a softcap at Level 100, which is why certain bonuses have two formulas listed. The first formula applies for Levels 0-100, then the second formula for any level past 100.
- If there is no second formula, that MacGuffin does not have a softcap, so the first formula applies for all levels

The SEXY/SMART guffs are cosmetic guffs, which provide a new player portrait at 250%. They were previously Energy/Magic Beard guffs, but were bugged and never worked
