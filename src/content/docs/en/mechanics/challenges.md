## Challenge Tips
(Most of these were originally from [Pokie’s Challenge Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HRXczqfv9lz1DMKUAG1uCYU21eZ2nKb7dHbydYJNLS0/edit#). Mainly aimed at CBlock 1)

100 Level Challenge
- Turn off Beards so they don’t use up allotted levels
- Pre-Boss 30: Split levels in Wandoos E/M dumps, rebirth when number gain is 10-100x
    - Once you have augs, split levels between the best augs you can buy and Wandoos
- Post-Boss 30: Get 59 Energy levels and 10 Magic levels in Time Machine for 100x gold
    - Remaining energy goes into Energy Busters augment
- Post-Boss 37: Build a few busters, save the rest of the levels for best magic ritual
- Utilize fast rebirths (ideally 3m, at least less than 10m)
- Remember to use Gold Diggers

No Augmentations
- Focus on Wandoos 98. Rebirth quickly, use Magic for Blood Number when possible

No Time Machine
- Focus Wandoos 98, buy 1-2 expensive augments then focus Blood Number
- Wear Wandoos accessories

Blind
- Essentially a Basic Challenge. More things will disappear as you complete more.
- You can deduce your Boss number by hovering over your HP Bar. Using scientific notation, the boss number is equivalent to the exponent + 2

No Equipment
- A very straightforward but slow challenge. Just climb slowly.

Troll
- You can see when a troll is coming by hovering over the Rebirth button
- If a Big troll is coming up, wait to rebirth until after the big troll
    - The worst big trolls will decimate your ability to climb any more, so you can rebirth to reset their effects and continue climbing

No NGUs
- Similarly to No Equipment, these are a straightforward but slow basic challenge

No Rebirth
- In CBlock 1, this should be the only challenge that uses Wandoos MEH over 98
- Can use Wandoos AT to get Wandoos speed up until you can get steady levels in MEH
- Try to cap Wandoos MEH if possible, use rest of your resources in TM / Augs
- Use the Wandoos digger, eat Fruit of Power
- For the longer NoRB challenges, they’re essentially just a waiting game, so you can also just take a break from the game and come back to them when complete

24 Hour
- Essentially a basic challenge. Remember that offline progress is disabled for 24H
