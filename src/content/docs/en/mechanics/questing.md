Unlocked upon defeating T6 (THE BEAST) and consuming the ‘Heroic Sigil’, Questing sends you on fetch quests in adventure zones to get Quirk Points (QP), which can be spent on Quirks. *All Quest progress is permanent and persists through rebirths.*

## How to Quest

When you start a quest, The Beast selects an adventure zone where you have maxed the set and a number of items to get   
There are two ways to complete quests: manual and idle

**Manual**: With a quest active, go to the given adventure zone and start farming
- Each adventure zone listed will now have a chance to drop a new quest item
- Quest items drop at a base drop chance of 5%
    - Drop Chance items/modifiers do NOT affect quest item drop chance
    - There will be a new stat “Quest Drops” which affects quest item DC
- As items drop, you can ctrl+click the item to submit a single item to the quest
- Right-clicking on a quest item will submit as many quest items as possible
- Completing a quest manually without using Idle Mode grants double rewards

**Idle**: Turn on Idle Mode (“SCREW THE GRIND I’LL SUBCONTRACT IT”)
- Idle Mode slowly gains progress in the bar without having to go to any adventure zone or collecting items. Every time the bar fills, an item will automatically be added to the quest progress.
- The speed of the Idle Mode bar depends on Respawn and Quest Drops
- If Idle Mode is on, you cannot get quest items from farming the quest zone

## Quest Types

There are two types of quests: Major Quests and Minor Quests
- Every 8 hours, you get a new Major Quest added to your bank, holding up to 10 majors
- Completing a Major Quest grants 5x the rewards of a Minor Quest, but uses up 1 Major
- While Minor Quests only give 1/5th of the rewards of a Major Quest, there are no limits on how many Minor Quests you can complete

| Manual Major | Idle Major | Manual Minor | Idle Minor |
| :----------: | :--------: | :----------: | :--------: |
| 100 QP/AP    | 50 QP/AP   | 20 QP/AP     | 10 QP/AP   |

## Quest Items

Quest items drop at Level 0, and can be merged to increase the level
- For each quest item maxed, you gain 2% QP rewards
    - Due to a rounding error in the way the game calculates QP bonuses, you will not get extra QP after maxing your first quest item (102% QP reward)
- Turning in higher level quest items does not give additional progress at the start
    - A Level 100 quest item will still only count as 1 item when submitted
    - Buying the ‘Bonus Quest Handin Progress’ perks/quirks will allow for quest items to be turned in at higher levels for more rewards, but these rewards are always less efficient than turning in single Level 0 quest items
