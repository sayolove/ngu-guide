Unlocked after defeating Boss 4, Adventure Mode allows the player to fight enemies for loot.

**Important Note:** The gear you get from farming in adventure is the main way to progress. The progression chapters are based on your adventure progress, as adventure mode is the main game.
- Fighting bosses is initially very useful for unlocking new features (until Boss 58)
    - After Boss 58, all features are now locked behind adventure progress, defeating Titans
    - Fighting bosses will continue to unlock new adventure zones and titans
    - However, if you’re unable to defeat previous zones/titans, there is no benefit in unlocking new zones that you cannot defeat enemies in
- Focusing Number typically leads to constantly getting stuck or progressing very slowly
    - Equipment provides an Attack/Defense boost based on its Power/Toughness
    - Many features operate very slowly, getting a new set of gear can rocket you ahead
- Maxing all the items in a set provides a permanent buff that can help other features

## Adventure Menu Sections
- At the top of the Adventure Menu in bold font, the zone title displays the name of the zone
    - Hovering over the title will display a tooltip with some information about the zone
    - From Beardverse on, the tooltip will also contain the Boss Drop chance
- In the top right corner, the Bestiary displays a list of enemies defeated
    - For plot enthusiasts, the Bestiary also contains story and flavor texts
- Under the title, there are three rows of skills that can be used to fight enemies
    - The top two rows of skills are unlocked as they are unlocked in Basic Training
    - The bottom row contains more skills that have other requirements to unlock
- On the right, navigate through adventure zones using the drop down and left/right arrows
    - To select a specific zone, click on the drop down and scroll to find your desired zone
    - Left-clicking the left/right arrows will move you backwards/forwards one zone
    - Right-clicking the left arrow will take you to the Safe Zone
    - Right-clicking the right arrow will take you to the furthest non-titan unlocked zone
- The middle displays the fight, with your adventure stats on the left, the enemy’s portrait in the middle, and the enemy’s stats and type on the right
- The bottom displays the battle log, which shows a log of the recent events in the fight
    - For certain Titan fights, reading the battle log as you fight will be crucial to the fight

## Fighting

There are two methods of fighting enemies in Adventure Mode:
- Idle Attack: always unlocked, attacks every 1 second, HP Regen +20%
    - Disables use of any other skills
- Manual Fighting: actively fighting using all other skills
    - Much stronger than Idle Attack
    - Typically recommended to manually fight Titans to unlock new features
    - Sometimes used to target Adventure Bosses for a better chance at gear
- For stats, the most important are power and toughness (in most cases: power > toughness)
    - Buying adventure stats is NOT recommended until end of evil (LRB to T9v4)
    - Buying adventure stats is a very short-term boost, it’s much more important to invest in permanent resources early on

## Loot

Whenever an enemy is killed in adventure, they have a chance of dropping loot in the Inventory. There are two types of enemies in adventure zones:
- Bosses have a yellow crown and (BOSS) in their name
- Regular enemies are any enemies that are not bosses

- In early zones, only bosses drop gear.
    - When manually fighting for gear, you can leave and re-enter the adventure zone (click left arrow, then right arrow) to try to get a different enemy to spawn. Using this method to only kill bosses for gear is known as Sniping
- Starting from Badly Drawn World, enemies will also drop gear, but at ⅓ of the drop rate
- The chance of getting an item from an enemy depends on your Drop Chance modifiers
    - Equipping items with the Drop Chance special will improve your odds for getting loot
    - From Chocolate World onwards, Drop Chance is cube-rooted

## Titans

Titans are stronger bosses in Adventure, each having their own adventure zone and cooldown.

- Titans are unlocked by defeating a specific Boss in Fight Boss
- Defeating a new Titan unlocks a new feature (up to T10)
- Each Titan has a cooldown period, which is reset on rebirth or on kill
    - The cooldown period can be reduced by 15 minutes per No Rebirth Challenge
    - The cooldown period cannot be reduced lower than 1 hour, the minimum cooldown
- Reaching a specific threshold of stats allows you to Auto Kill (AK) titans without going to their adventure zone. This works online or offline, but gear is only granted online
    - This can be turned off online using the ‘Automatically Kill Titans’ toggle in Settings
    - This setting does not work offline, which will always try to AK titans (at v1)
- Being defeated by a Titan sends you to the Safe Zone with no penalties
- All Titans grow in strength by 1% per attack

## ITOPOD

The Infinite Tower of Pissed-Off Dudes (ITOPOD) is a special adventure zone unlocked by consuming the Pissed-Off Key from The Sky. Instead of a standard set of adventure enemies, the ITOPOD is composed of 1600 floors, with each successive floor having stronger enemies.

*Note:* Purchasing ‘The Pack of Pissed Off Dudes’ ($60 USD) adds your name to the ITOPOD

You can enter the ITOPOD through the Adventure tab, using the ‘Enter the ITOPOD’ button.
- You climb from the Start Floor to the End Floor, restarting on death or completion
    - Your Start Floor cannot be higher than one lower than your highest reached floor
    - Your End Floor cannot be lower than your Start Floor, or higher than 1600 (final floor)
    - Killing 10 enemies consecutively on a floor will unlock the next floor
    - Each floor has enemies that are 1.05x stronger than the previous floor
- Selecting ‘Optimal Floor’ will set your Start/End Floor to the highest one-shot zone
    - Known Bug: Optimal Floor calculation assumes Spoopy set max bonus, so before getting that set, sometimes it will place you 4 floors lower than your highest 1-shot floor
- Selecting ‘Max Floor’ will set your Start Floor to the highest available floor
    - Helps set up to climb your highest floor, set End Floor to 1600 to climb
    - If you have the Lazy ITOPOD Shifter, this must be turned off to climb max floor
- Little Blue Pills are an AP consumable, which doubles PP for a single ITOPOD kill
- Lazy ITOPOD Shifter is an AP purchase that calculates your Optimal floor after every kill

### ITOPOD Rewards

Killing enemies grants a number of progress points towards earning Perk Points (PP)
- Each enemy grants (200 + floor) progress points, 1 million progress points giving 1 PP
- PP can be spent in the ITOPOD Perks menu in Adventure for various benefits
    - Check your progression chapter for a list of suggested perk purchases
    - Tip: Right-clicking on a perk will buy as many levels as you can afford
- Every 10 floors, when you clear the floor for the first time ever, you get a PP reward
    - This reward is multiplied by 10 for every 100th floor, and then increases by 1 for next
    - Floors 10, 20, 30, … , 90 give 1 PP. Floor 100 gives 10 PP
    - Floors 110, 120, 130, … , 190 gives 2 PP. Floor 200 gives 20 PP
- Enemies will occasionally drop EXP, AP, and boosts depending on ITOPOD floor
    - Boosts drop at a flat 14% DC, not affected by DC modifiers/gear. Boosts drop at Level 1
    - Can max out boosts in ITOPOD since you only need half the boost drops

### Farming ITOPOD
In the early game (pre-T4/Chapter 3), it’s not advised to spend time farming ITOPOD
- Without significant PP modifiers, respawn, and power, your PP gain is negligible
- Can climb max floor when you can reach a new 10 floor breakpoint for PP rewards

Later, it’s typical to farm ITOPOD at Optimal Floor between adventure zones
- While farming pod, the only two stats that affect PP output is Power and Respawn
- Wear a few respawn items to spawn enemies faster for more PP
    - Wear RoG always, add Stapler at 7 acc slots, Green Heart at 9 acc slots
    - From Evil onwards, a general rule of thumb is ⅓ of total acc slots = respawn
