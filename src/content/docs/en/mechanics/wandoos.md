Unlocked by consuming ‘A busted copy of Wandoos 98’, Wandoos (a crappy operating system by macaroonsoft) uses Energy/Magic to provide a multiplier to Attack/Defense stats for Fight Boss. Once unlocked, Wandoos is permanently unlocked.

## Boot-up
At the start of each rebirth, Wandoos takes 1 hour to boot up to max speed
- It is not necessary to be online for the boot up process, will continue offline
- Speed increase is linear from 0% to 100% speed through the boot up time
- Boot-up time can be reduced by 10% by maxing the Wandoos XL item
    - Also sped up by 10% for each Evil 100 Level Challenge
    - Minimum boot time with all reductions is 27 minutes (60 x 90% x 50%)

## Wandoos Operating Systems
Wandoos has three operating systems (OS) that can be used: Wandoos 98, MEH, and XL
- Each operating system must be unlocked separately, but OS unlocks are permanent
- Wandoos 98: Consumable item drop from The Sky / T1 / T2 / AB / AVSP
- Wandoos MEH: Maxing the set bonus for T3
- Wandoos XL: Consumable item drop from T5 / BDW / BAE

| Operating System | Base E/M to BB | Stat Bonus Formula                                 |
| :--------------: | :------------: | :------------------------------------------------: |
| Wandoos 98       | 1B (1e9)       | ((1+Energy Level/100) x (1+Magic Level/25))^0.8    |
| Wandoos MEH      | 1T (1e12)      | (1+Energy Level/5) x (1+Magic Level x 2)           |
| Wandoos XL       | 1q (1e15)      | ((1+Energy Level x 6) x (1+Magic Level x 40))^1.05 |

## Using Wandoos

- Wandoos provides two stats that can be leveled up: Energy Dump and Magic Dump
    - Each dump uses its respective resource to provide an Attack/Defense multiplier
    - Each dump’s bonus level is calculated separately then multiplied together
- Wandoos levels do not scale, but Wandoos does not use Energy/Magic Power, only Cap
- Energy/Magic Dump levels are lost on rebirth and whenever the Wandoos OS is changed

## Switching OS

Improving the OS improves the stat bonus formula, but costs more E/M to get levels in
- Switching to a better OS before you have enough E/M to get enough levels will reduce your stat bonus, so it’s better to stick with the lower OS until you can get enough levels:
    - 5 minutes of MEH BB provides better bonuses than 24 hours of 98 BB
    - 1 level/s of XL provides better bonuses than 24 hours of MEH BB

## Wandoos OS Levels

The Wandoos OS can be leveled up to improve the base speed of E/M Dump levels

- There are four sources of Wandoos OS levels, each with a maximum of 100 levels:
    - Wandoos 98 Levels: Earned by consuming ‘A busted copy of Wandoos 98’ levels
    - Wandoos XL Levels: Earned by consuming ‘A busted copy of Wandoos XL’ levels
    - Money Pit Levels: Earned as a random reward from the Money Pit
    - ITOPOD Levels: Earned by buying levels of the ITOPOD Perk ‘Wandoos Lover’
- All Wandoos OS levels are preserved through rebirths, nothing removes OS levels
- All four sources’s levels are combined for the total Wandoos OS level, max 400 levels
- Your total Wandoos OS level increases your Base E/M Dump level speed by 4% per level
    - This OS level speed buff applies to all operating systems, regardless of what is enabled
- Leveling up the Wandoos 98/XL OS level requires consuming the respective item at a higher level than your current OS level. Excess levels will be preserved on the item.
    - For example, if your Wandoos 98 OS level is Level 3, you need to consume a copy of ‘A busted copy of Wandoos 98’ that is at least Level 4. If you consume an item at Level 10, this will upgrade your Wandoos 98 OS level to Level 4, but the item will become Level 6
    - Getting to Level 100 OS level requires consuming 5151 levels of the respective item

## Wandoos Speed across Difficulties

In Evil and Sadistic difficulties, there are additional speed dividers that slow down Wandoos   
For a few comparisons:
- E/M requirements increase by 1000x in Normal, but increase by 1e6x for Evil/Sadistic
- Evil Wandoos 98 costs 1e6x more E/M than Normal Wandoos XL
- Sadistic Wandoos 98 costs the same as Evil Wandoos XL

| Wandoos OS  | E/M to BB (Normal) | E/M to BB (Evil) | E/M to BB (Sadistic) |
| :---------: | :----------------: | :--------------: | :------------------: |
| Wandoos 98  | 1e9                | 1e21             | 1e33                 |
| Wandoos MEH | 1e12               | 1e27             | 1e39                 |
| Wandoos XL  | 1e15               | 1e33             | 1e45                 |
