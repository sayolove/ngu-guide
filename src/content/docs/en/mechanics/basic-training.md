Basic Training uses Energy to raise your Attack/Defense for fighting bosses. There are two types of skills, Attack and Defense, with each type having six skills. The first skill of each type is always unlocked, but the following skills require a certain amount of levels in the previous skill:

| Attack Skills   | Defense Skills | Required Levels to Unlock |
| :-------------: | :------------: | :-----------------------: |
| Idle Attack     | Block          | Always unlocked           |
| Regular Attack  | Defensive Buff | 5k                        |
| Strong Attack   | Heal           | 10k                       |
| Parry           | Offensive Buff | 15k                       |
| Piercing Attack | Charge         | 20k                       |
| Ultimate Attack | Ultimate Buff  | 25k                       |

As skills are unlocked in Basic Training, the same skill will be unlocked in Adventure Mode. Gaining more levels in a skill does not impact the effectiveness of the Adventure Mode skill, but it does contribute towards your Attack/Defense at a rate of Level^1.3 x Basevalue:

| Attack Skills   | Defense Skills | Base Value | Base Cap | RBs to 1 cap |
| :-------------: | :------------: | :--------: | :------: | :----------: |
| Idle Attack     | Block          | 150        | 2.5k     | 57           |
| Regular Attack  | Defensive Buff | 1k         | 15k      | 74           |
| Strong Attack   | Heal           | 2k         | 30k      | 81           |
| Parry           | Offensive Buff | 10k        | 50k      | 86           |
| Piercing Attack | Charge         | 50k        | 70k      | 89           |
| Ultimate Attack | Ultimate Buff  | 200k       | 100k     | 92           |

- Each skill has a cap, or an amount of energy needed to gain levels at max speed (50/s)
- Gaining levels in a skill will decrease its cap for next rebirth, up to 10% per rebirth
- Hovering over a skill shows its current cap and what the cap will be next rebirth
    - The cap for next rebirth will be colored green when max cap reduction is reached
- Each skill’s cap can be reduced to 1 energy, then only needing 12 energy for all skills

## Tips and Tricks

- Turn on ‘Sync Training’ in Settings to have your energy split between Attack/Defense skills
- To add energy to a skill, enter an amount in the Input field at the top and press the + button next to the desired skill, which will add energy to the skill from your idle energy
- Clicking the ‘Cap’ button will allocate the minimum amount of idle energy needed for the fastest leveling speed for that skill
    - If you have leftover energy after clicking Cap on a skill, adding more energy to that skill would not speed up the training any more

Early in the game, one of the first priorities should be to reduce Basic Training caps
- Reducing BT caps will free up energy to be used for other features

Once your caps are low enough that you can start capping your skills:
- Training Auto-Advance (300 EXP, EXP Shop > Misc) automatically transfers any extra energy to the skill below it once it unlocks if there is more energy than needed to cap
    - Right-click the + button to assign energy to cap that skill and all skills below it
- Insta Training Cap (10k AP, Sellout Shop > Special 1) automatically assigns 6 energy to the first skill of each type at the beginning of the rebirth
    - Once all skills have reached 1 cap, this allows for Basic Training to be automated

Unlocking all the Basic Training skills unlocks Advanced Training
