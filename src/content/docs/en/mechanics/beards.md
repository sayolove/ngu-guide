Unlocked upon defeating T4 (UUG, The Unmentionable) and consuming ‘UUG’s Armpit Hair’, Beards of Power provide passive gains after your energy/magic have reached their cap.

## Beard Levels

Each beard has two types of levels: temporary and permanent
- Beards passively gain temporary levels after Energy/Magic has reached its cap
    - Beard speed is proportional to ![Beards Formula](/ngu-guide/beards.png) for the utilized resource
- When you rebirth, active beards convert a portion of their temporary levels to permanent levels, based on how long the rebirth was
    - Permanent levels gained: ![Beard Perm Formula](/ngu-guide/beardPERM.png)
    - The time factor starts at 0, then increases by ⅓ every hour until reaching a maximum of 8 at 24 hours.
    - The Five O’Clock Shadow perk speeds up the time factor, reducing the total time to reach the maximum time factor by 1 hour per level
- Temporary and permanent beard levels stack multiplicatively with each other
- Temporary levels are reset on rebirth, permanent levels persist through rebirths

There are 7 beards:
- Energy Beards:
    - Neckbeard (2) - Grants Drop Chance
    - Beard Cage (4) - Grants NGU speed
    - BEARd (6) - Grants Adventure stats

    - Reverse Hitler (3) - Grants Number
