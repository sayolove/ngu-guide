## Text Guide for Cooking
1. For each ingredient, while other ingredients are at 0, watch the value of the meal efficiency while changing the value of the ingredient from 0 to 20. Write down any local peaks (there’s typically 1-3 values). 
    - For example, if 14 cloves of garlic gives 11% meal efficiency, 15 cloves gives 13% efficiency, and 16 cloves gives 12% efficiency, 15 is a peak for garlic
2. Compare across ingredients, you should find pairs of ingredients with the same peaks
    - With less than 8 ingredients, some ingredients may not have a pair. For these singular ingredients, just find the maximum efficiency you can obtain and keep it there.
3. For every pair of ingredients A and B, set A to one of its peak amounts. Then cycle B from 0 to 20, looking for the highest meal efficiency value. Repeat for all peaks, until you find the highest value across all peaks. Set both ingredients to obtain the highest value.

### Notes
- Each gear equipped with Cooking special will contribute 3% to the Total Cooking Bonus
    - Gear does not consider level or boosts, Lvl 1 GRB gear is the same as maxed + green
    - The Bloody Cleaver must be in the primary (top) weapon slot to provide a bonus
    - Due to a bug, GRB legs count twice
- For players that want to avoid having to click excessively, after clicking on the - or + button of an ingredient, hitting Space Bar will continue decrementing/incrementing the amount of an ingredient. Alternatively, some players utilize an auto-clicker.
- It is always possible to get 100%, regardless of the number of ingredients you have
- If a meal is ready to eat but not eaten, the timer banks 24.5 hours towards the next meal
    - Cooking unlocks with a full bank, so you can eat two meals immediately
- Cooking has a bug that allows for players to trigger the ending without completing THE END. To replicate the bug: Click the + in for the top right ingredient, press the right arrow on your keyboard once, then press enter.

### History
For years, Cooking had just been a meme stat, initially added to the GRB set as a way to nerf the specials. People would joke in the Discord about the existence of a Cooking mini-game, eventually leading to pokie’s [Cooking Mini-Game Guide](https://imgur.com/a/vFSE8mX).
