Using the Attack/Defense stats you have been building up in Basic Training, you can fight bosses to unlock new features and increase your Number. In addition to Attack/Defense:
- Max HP - Increasing Attack increases Max HP by Attack * 10
- HP Regen - Increasing Defense increases HP Regen by Defense/20

If you are significantly stronger than the boss, you can skip bosses with the nuke button, which kills all bosses that you can kill instantly (when you have ~1k times the stats of the boss)

At the beginning of the game, fighting bosses is the main way to unlock features, but after boss 58, fighting bosses is mostly used to unlock new adventure zones and titans.
