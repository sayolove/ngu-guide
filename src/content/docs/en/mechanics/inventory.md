This menu allows players to manage and equip loot dropped from enemies in Adventure Mode.
- Inventory items persist through rebirths and challenges, nothing will reset your items
- Items do not drop offline, you can only get items when the game is open
- If your inventory is full, any items that drop are immediately discarded
    - This can show in the Item List as having obtained the item

Equipping gear by placing the gear onto the player slots allows you to gain the gear’s bonuses.   
**Gear is a driving force of progression**: if you find yourself stuck, you probably need better gear.
- Most Adventure zones drop a full set of equipment: Head, Chest, Legs, Boots, Weapon
- Some sets also include accessories
    - Duplicates of the same accessory cannot be equipped or put in Daycare
- Maxing all the items in a set grants the set bonus, which can be checked in the Item List
- Each adventure zone also has a bonus accessory, which is not a part of the zone’s set. These accessories are a part of the Bonus Accessories set, consisting of one accessory in each zone. All accessories must be maxed for the set bonus, so it is not possible to get the set bonus until the last adventure zone of that difficulty
    - These bonus accessories were added later in the game to help players progress

## Leveling Items

- Items can be leveled from 0 up to 100, which is considered as maxing an item
    - A Level 100 item has double the stats of a Level 0 item, each level raises stats by 1%
- An item’s level can be increased by merging it with duplicates of the same item
    - Merge by dragging and dropping items on top of each other, or hover item and D + click
    - The levels of the components will be combined + 1: Level 5 + Level 3 = Level 9
    - Items start at Level 0: Merging a Level 0 gives 1 level, Level 1 gives 2 levels, etc.
    - If merging two items with different stats, the final item will have the max of each stat
    - Example: 3 power/1 toughness + 1 power/5 toughness = 3 power/5 toughness

## Boosting Items

In addition to gear, enemies also drop boosts, which can be used to empower your gear
- There are three types of boosts: Power, Toughness, and Special
    - Power and Toughness boosts raise the Power/Toughness stats of the item
    - Gear P/T also contributes towards your Attack/Defense, +1% A/D per P/T
    - Special boosts raise other special stats that the item may have
- Boosts can be applied to an item by dragging the boost on top of the item
    - Shortcut: While hovering over an item, A + click applies all possible boosts
- Boosting an item to max boost is called greening the item, since the stats are all green
- Boosts can also be leveled, with each boost maxed giving 2% boost power to all boosts
    - Boosts with higher levels do not give more boost power or any other benefit
    - Early on, you should focus on greening gear first, then maxing boosts for the 2% bonus

## Inventory Shortcuts

- A + Click: Uses all unprotected, applicable boosts on the clicked item
- D + Click: Merges all unprotected, duplicate items of the clicked item
    - Turning on ‘Simple Inventory Shortcuts’ in Settings removes the click for the two above
- Shift + Click: Protects an item, preventing it from being consumed or trashed
- Ctrl + Click: 
    - If an item is consumable, consumes the item
    - If an item is transformable, transforms the item
    - If neither and the item is unprotected, moves the item to the trash
- Right Click:
    - Equipped items: unequips the item, places in inventory
    - Inventory items: equips the item, swapping out the item in current slot
- 1/2/3/… (top row number keys): Go to inventory page of the corresponding number

## Item List
Item List is a paged list of all the items that can be dropped in Adventure Mode
- Once an item has been obtained, the item permanently appears in the Item List
    - Having an item drop while your inventory is full will trigger the item to appear
- Items that have been maxed will be highlighted with a red border and says MAXXED
- Sets that have a completion bonus that has been met will be marked with COMPLETE

## Infinity Cube

Unlocked after maxing 4G’s Merge and Boost Tutorial Cube (accessory in Tutorial Zone)
- Once unlocked, appears permanently to the right of the weapon slot in Inventory menu
- The Infinity Cube serves as an infinite boost dump, giving 1% of boost strength as P/T
    - P/T boosts add 1% of its boost strength to the respective stat
    - Special boosts are split equally between P/T (0.5% of boost strength to each)
- Add boosts to Infinity Cube by dragging boosts onto the cube or ctrl+clicking the boost
    - Right-Clicking or A+clicking the cube will apply all non-protected boosts to the cube
    - Auto Boost will apply all leftover boosts after equipment/auto-merge slots to the cube
- Tiers: The cube can permanently level up as its total stats (P+T) reaches specific amounts
    - Cube starts at Tier 0 with no bonuses, reaches the Tier 1 at 100 total P+T stats
    - After Tier 1, every tier is 10x the previous tier, so Tier 2 is 1k stats, Tier 3 is 10k, etc
    - As new tiers are unlocked, new skins for the cube are also unlocked
    - Skins can be cycled by left-clicking on the cube. Skins are purely cosmetic.
    - For a full list of cube tiers, bonuses, and skin appearances, see the wiki
- Softcap: The cube’s power and toughness stats reach a softcap at base + equipment stats
    - Any excess P/T amount above the softcap will only grant a square root of the excess
    - Example: If base power is 400 and equipment power is at 600, cube power softcap would be at 1000. If the cube has 1100 power, since it is 100 above the softcap, the 100 gets square rooted to 10, and the Infinity Cube would give 1010 power
    - Softcaps only affect the P/T given from the cube, does not affect tier or true cube value

## Item Daycare

Item Daycare uses the power of the Daycare Kitty to level up items slowly over time
- Useful for items that are difficult to level up normally (e.g. hearts, AFPs, Looties)
- Suggested Usage: Hearts > AFPs/Looties > High rarity items > Anything else
- The time per level is different for each item, typically ranging from 1-48 hours in Normal
- Must be unlocked by buying a Daycare slot for the button to appear in Inventory
- There are 6 total daycare slots, with 4 available in Normal: 
    - 3 from EXP Shop under Adventure Special for 250, 25k, and 500k EXP
    - 1 from the 10th completion of the Blind Challenge

There are two methods of speeding up the Daycare, both multiplicative bonuses:
- Time Reductions (reduces time until completion) - Retroactive: Affects items currently in daycare slots for the length of time they have been in daycare (since the last time it was placed in a slot, not any time before)
    - Example: If Yellow Heart is in a daycare slot for 2 weeks before the Blind Challenges in CBlock1, you can immediately get some levels while completing the blinds. It recalculates the amount of time needed for each level, then applies the duration of how long the heart has currently been in daycare
    - Sources:
        - 85% from Normal Blind Challenges
        - 95% from ITOPOD Perk: Daycare Kitty’s Blessing I (5 PP/level, 5 levels)
        - 95% from ITOPOD Perk: Daycare Kitty’s Blessing II (25 PP/level, 5 levels)
        - 90% from AP Sellout Shop: Daycare Speed Boost (125k AP)
- Speed Increases (increases daycare speed) - Not Retroactive: Just a base increase to daycare speed.
