Advanced Training (AT, displayed in the menu as Adv. Training) is unlocked once you unlock the final Attack/Defense skills (Ultimate Attack/Ultimate Buff) in Basic Training. Advanced Training only uses Energy, and AT levels are reset upon rebirth.

The Advanced Training skills initially available are:
- Adventure Toughness/Power +: These provide a direct multiplier to your Toughness and Power Adventure stats, with diminishing returns.
- Block Damage: This increases the effectiveness of your Block skillâ€™s damage reduction, improving from the base value of 50%, with diminishing returns toward 100%. 

When you unlock the Wandoos feature, you gain two more available skills:
- Wandoos E/M Dump +: These provide a direct Wandoos speed multiplier for your Wandoos E/M dumps, respectively, at 1% per level.

As Advanced Training levels are temporary, only lasting for the duration of the current rebirth, it is not generally advised to spend too much time leveling Advanced Training, especially if there are other features that provide a more permanent boost. However, Advanced Training should not be ignored, as the short-term boost that it provides can be utilized to access higher zones. In most rebirths, you should aim to spend a small to moderate amount of time focusing AT.

The true utility of Advanced Training lies in long rebirths (LRBs), utilized when a short-term burst of adventure stats provides a stronger boost to progression than slow, permanent gains. This usually occurs before specific Titans that provide important features.

- Running Basic Training at 50 levels/s, the fastest you can unlock AT is at 25 minutes
- AT speed is linearly proportional to the amount of energy invested (ECap), but only utilizes the square root of EPow, so cap affects AT more than power
- The cost of a level in Advanced Training is linearly proportional to its level
    - It will take twice as long to get from Level 1 to 2 than from Level 0 to 1
    - The base cost of AT levels are equal for Power/Toughness/Block
    - The Wandoos skills have double the cost (twice as slow, or need twice the energy)
- AT P/T bonuses scale at x0.4, meaning doubling AT P/T levels will increase P/T by ~32%
- Block Reduction reaches 90% at Level 400, 99% at 5k, 99.9% at 5, and 99.99% at 500k
    - After 1m levels, the UI rounds the display to 100%, but it never truly blocks all damage
