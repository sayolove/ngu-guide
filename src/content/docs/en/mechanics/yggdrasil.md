Unlocked upon defeating T2 (Grand Corrupted Tree) and consuming ‘A Giant Seed’, Yggdrasil, The World Tree (Ygg) allows you to grow fruits over time that you can eat for different bonuses.

## Seeds

Seeds are used to unlock and upgrade new fruits. Unlocking a fruit allows you to grow the fruit for one hour, and each upgrade to a fruit extends the duration it can grow by another hour.

There are multiple sources of seeds:
- Consuming ‘A Giant Seed’ grants a number of seeds based on the level of the item.
    - Each level awards 1 seed, plus a 1% bonus, rounded down.
    - At Level 0, it grants 1 seed, at max level, it grants 200 seeds.
- The Money Pit and the Daily Spin can also give seeds as a random reward
- Eating fruits grants seeds based on tier, harvesting fruits grants double the seeds
- Fruits can be upgraded up to Tier 10 initially
    - Completing Troll Challenge 3 unlocks all fruits to be upgraded up to Tier 24
- Seeds, fruit unlocks, and tier upgrades all persist through rebirths

## Activation

Fruits cost energy or magic to activate. The cost will be subtracted from your idle energy/magic, which starts to regenerate immediately.

Once you have 10x the total energy/magic cap of a fruit’s activation cost, you can use EXP to purchase that fruit’s Auto-Activate, which will automatically activate the fruit whenever possible with no energy/magic cost. Auto-Activate does not eat/harvest fruits, that must still be done manually

## Eating/Harvesting 

- Eating fruits will give you a fruit-specific bonus and some seeds.
- Harvesting fruits will not give the fruit-specific bonus, but gives twice as many seeds
- Higher tier fruits provide better rewards than lower tier fruits, with each tier providing 1.5x better rewards than the previous tier. A Tier 10 fruit provides 32x the rewards of a Tier 1.

## Poop

Poop is a consumable that increases eating/harvesting rewards by 50%.   
There are multiple sources of poop:
- Purchased with AP from the Sellout Store (Boosts 2)
- Rare drop from Icarus Proudbottom in The Sky (0.05% base chance, up to 0.5% max)
- Drop from the ITOPOD after buying the ‘What a Crappy Perk’ ITOPOD perk (25 PP)
- Gives 1 poop every 9000 kills (both online/offline) and 0.01% chance per kill
- One-time bonus of 10 Poop from maxing the Giant Seed
