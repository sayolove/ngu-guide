Unlocked upon defeating T5 (Walderp), MacGuffin Fragments (guffs) are unique items that can drop from adventure zones and provide permanent bonuses on rebirth. Unlike other features, MacGuffins does not have its own tab, but appears as a sub-menu in the Inventory tab.

## Obtaining MacGuffins

To obtain a MacGuffin, you must kill 1000 consecutive enemies in an adventure zone
- Switching to another zone, dying, or closing the game will reset the kill count
    - You can check your current kill count by hovering over the zone name in Adventure
- The number of kills needed can be lowered with perks and future set bonuses
- The perk ‘MacGuffin ITOPOD Drops!’ (50 PP) enables MacGuffins to drop in the ITOPOD, dropping any previous unlocked MacGuffin once every 5000 kills

## Leveling MacGuffins

MacGuffins can be leveled by merging duplicates of the same MacGuffin, just like items
- Leveling up MacGuffins will increase their bonus on rebirth, making them more effective
- MacGuffins do not have a level cap, meaning they can be leveled past Level 100
    - Once a MacGuffin reaches Level 100, in the Item List they will appear as MAXXED
- MacGuffins cannot be placed in the Daycare without the Evil perk ‘MacGuffin Daycare!’
    - After buying the perk (5k PP), guffs level up at a base rate of 1 level per 2 hours

## MacGuffin Slots

MacGuffin Fragments only provide bonuses when equipped in a MacGuffin slot on rebirth
- Unlocking MacGuffins provides 1 slot unlocked, with a total of 22 obtainable slots: 
    - 2 can be bought with EXP in the Misc tab (10M EXP, 100M EXP)
    - 2 from ITOPOD Perks (250 PP, 5k PP)
    - 11 can be bought with AP (first two: 100k AP, all others: 225k AP)
    - 6 other slots come from future features or are obtainable in Evil
- MacGuffin slots will utilize Auto-Merge to merge any duplicates in the Inventory

## MacGuffin Bonuses
- On rebirth, any MacGuffins equipped in MacGuffin slots will provide a permanent bonus
- Bonuses persist through rebirths and remains active if the MacGuffin is unequipped
- If there is a previous MacGuffin bonus, the new bonus is added on top of the old total
- The bonus given depends on the MacGuffin type, its level, and the rebirth time
    - The time factor is optimal at 30 minutes, increasing with diminishing returns afterwards
    - The time factor goes up to ~6.93 at 24 hours, and caps at 20 at 200 hours
