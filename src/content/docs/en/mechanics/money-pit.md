The Money Pit allows players to discard all their current gold in return for a random reward. It is unlocked when the player has 100k gold, which is the minimum amount needed for a reward.

## Cooldown
The cooldown starts at one hour, and increases by one hour every time the pit is used
- After first feeding, the cooldown is 2 hours, then 3 hours, then 4 hours, etc.
- The cooldown is reset to 1 hour after a rebirth, keeping track of last pit time
    - If you used the pit 15 minutes ago, you have to wait 45 minutes after rebirthing to use
    - If it has been more than an hour since last pit use, the pit is available immediately
- The Money Pit tab lights up in green when the Money Pit is available to be used.

## Pit Runs (T8+)

At 10T (1e13) gold and above, the Money Pit starts giving a reward of all equipment or daycare items shockwave, which increases the level of each item equipped or in a daycare slot. Some players utilize this reward to farm levels of gear that are very difficult to farm, such as pendant and looty ascensions. This involves an active playstyle of rebirthing every hour.

## Daily Spin
Located within the Money Pit tab, the Daily Spin grants a daily chance to win a random reward.
- The cooldown for the Daily Spin is always 24 hours
- After the Daily Spin is available, up to 12 hours are banked towards the next spin timer
    - 7-Day Time Bank for Daily Spin! (100k AP, Sellout Shop > Special 1) extends this bank
- When the Daily Spin is available, the Money Pit tab will light up in yellow
    - If the Money Pit is available, the Money Pit’s green light overrides Daily Spin’s yellow
