Unlocked upon defeating T7 (Greasy Nerd) and consuming the ‘Incriminating Evidence’, Hacks also permanently unlock the third resource: Resource 3 (R3)

- Resource 3 is randomly named when unlocked, with a yellow default color
- You can change the name and color of Resource 3 in the second page of Settings
- The Resource 3 Name Randomizer (85k AP) changes the name every rebirth

Hacks provide permanent bonuses to various features and can be leveled up by allocating R3. Each level provides a small bonus, but every certain number of levels, hacks reach a milestone, which gives a multiplicative bonus to the total hack bonus, and stacks multiplicatively.

- Hacks persist all progress through rebirths
- The number of levels required per milestone can be reduced via perks and quirks
- Hacks do not affect Normal difficulty
