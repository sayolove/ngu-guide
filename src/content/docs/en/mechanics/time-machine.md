Unlocked upon defeating Boss 30, the Broken Time Machine (TM) provides continuous gold per second (GPS) by automatically farming enemies for gold. (It’s broken because it only gives gold)

TM gold production is based on the **highest gold drop in the current rebirth**, times multipliers.
- To improve gold production, wear gear with Gold Drops while killing in the furthest adventure zone or Titan you can kill. It’s not necessary to keep Gold Drops on after the kill.

The bar at the bottom fills up over time and awards you the resultant number of gold once filled. There are two stats to level up to increase the gold output: Machine Speed and Gold Multiplier
- Each level requires both a gold cost and E/M input, respectively.
- TM levels are lost upon rebirth.
	
**Machine Speed**: Utilizes energy to increase the rate that the bar fills up (bar speed). Unlike other features, Machine Speed is not tick limited (e.g. Level 25 -> 26 linearly increases the bar speed, not through tick calculations). At Level 49, the bar speed reaches maximum speed (50/s). From Level 50 onwards, levels add a new linear multiplier to gold output

**Gold Multiplier**: Utilizes magic for a direct linear multiplier to gold output

There are many other multipliers to TM production:
- Highest Boss Ever Defeated - 27
- Blood Magic Counterfeit Gold
- NoTM Challenge completions
- NGU Time Machine (and indirectly NGU Gold, which affects Gold Drops)
- Other sources unlock as you progress further
