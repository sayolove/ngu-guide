title: "Augmentation"
description: "Augmentation"
---

Unlocked after defeating Boss 17, you can build augmentations to improve your Attack/Defense.
- Augmentations (augments/augs) are a multiplicative boost to your Attack/Defense
- Multipliers from different augmentations stack additively to each other
    - Itâ€™s more efficient to focus on one augmentation than running multiple
- Augmentation levels are reset on rebirth

Augments cost gold and energy, with speed linearly proportional to Energy Power and amount
- Gold and energy costs increase linearly with levels
    - Example: Safety Scissors Level 1 costs 10k gold, L2 costs 20k, L3 costs 30k, etc.
- Each augmentation has an upgrade, which provides a multiplier to the base stat multiplier
    - Upgrades cost more gold than the augmentation, but typically run faster
    - Upgrades multiply the bonus by 1 + Level2 and costs Gold Cost + Level2
- Each augmentation must be unlocked by defeating a specific boss for each augmentation
