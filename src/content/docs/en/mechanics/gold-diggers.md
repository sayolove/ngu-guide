Unlocked after defeating T3 (Jake From Accounting) and consuming ‘A Scrap of Paper’, Gold Diggers consume a constant drain of gold production from TM to provide various bonuses.

## Unlocking/Upgrading Diggers

- Each Gold Digger needs to be unlocked by paying a one-time gold fee
- After being unlocked, gold diggers can be upgraded with increasing one-time gold fees
- Each upgrade unlocks a new level that the gold digger can be run at, providing better benefits at the cost of more gold drain
    - For diggers on the first page, their upgrade costs increase by 1.5x per level
    - On the second/third page, their upgrade costs increase by 1.75x per level
- Upgrading diggers also provides a global bonus to all diggers, up to 0.05% per level
    - Even if you don’t use a specific digger, you should still upgrade all diggers
- All digger unlocks and upgrades are permanent and persist through rebirths

## Using Diggers

- After unlocking a gold digger, you can activate it by toggling its Digger Active box
    - If you do not have the gold production to afford the digger, you cannot activate it
- After purchasing upgrades for a digger, you can decide what level to run that digger at
    - First page diggers cost 1.5x more per level, second/third page cost 1.75x more per level
    - You cannot increase the level of a digger beyond what your gold production can afford

## Digger Slots

- You can run as many active diggers as you have digger slots
- After unlocking Gold Diggers, you have one digger slot provided by default
- There are 12 total obtainable digger slots, allowing you to enable all diggers constantly
    - It’s not recommended to buy all 12 digger slots, as you never need to run every digger
    - You never need more than 9 digger slots
- Sources for other digger slots:
    - 1 from maxing ‘A Scrap of Paper’
    - 1 from EXP Shop (25k EXP)
    - 6 from AP Shop (first slot is 110k AP, every slot after is 225k AP)
    - 2 from ITOPOD Perks (25 PP, 250 PP)
    - 1 from completing No Time Machine Challenge 5
