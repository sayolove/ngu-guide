## Ticks
NGU Idle operates on a tick system with a tick rate of 1/50th of a second, or 50 ticks/second. The game is updated every tick, and most features are limited to gaining at most one level/tick. This limits most features to a speed cap of 50 levels/second (or 4.32 million levels/day). When a feature is running at this max speed of 50 levels/second, this is referred to as BB.

## Resources
Allocating resources in different features is one of the core mechanics of NGU Idle. There are three resources: Energy, Magic, and R3. Each resource is represented by a bar in the top left, which fills over time from the beginning of the rebirth once the resource has been unlocked.

Each resource has four properties:
- Speed - Buying speed increases the rate that the resource bar fills.
    - Capped at 50
- Power - Increases the effectiveness of the resource
    - Capped at 1e18 (pre-potions)
- Cap - Increases the maximum quantity of the resource
    - Capped at 9e18
- Bars - Increases the amount of resource granted each time the bar is filled
    - Capped at 1e18 (pre-bar bar)

As the resource bar fills, that resource is generated as idle resource, which is available to be allocated into features. Resources will be generated until you reach your total resource cap. When you rebirth, your available resources will be reset to zero, but you always keep your resource properties (speed/power/cap/bars).

When allocating resources, the output of your resources is generally amount allocated * power:
- Basic Training and Wandoos are not affected by Power
- Advanced Training only uses the square root of power (amount * power)


## Difficulties
NGU Idle has three difficulties, visible on the Rebirth page. The game starts on Normal difficulty, and the player is able to progress through each difficulty chronologically. Each successive difficulty adds new boss stories, adventure zones, titans, and features to explore.

## Saves
NGU Idle saves your progress through a text file representation of your progress. By default, these files are located in C:\Users\<Your Name>\AppData\LocalLow\NGU Industries\NGU Idle. It is highly recommended to save often, players that only depend on auto saves have rarely, but occasionally lost months of progress or quit from having their saves corrupt or be overridden.

There are a few methods of saving:
- Manual Saves - Clicking the ‘Save Game’ button allows you to save your game to a file
    - Once a day, the game also provides a little AP bonus for saving your game manually
    - After clicking the ‘Save Game’ button, while the game is waiting for you to decide a location/name for your file, the game is paused. This can be helpful in certain scenarios.
- Auto Save - Every 30 seconds, the game will auto-save your progress to a file
    - This file is always named the same way, so each save will override the previous save
    - When playing on Steam, the game will also save to the Steam cloud every 30 seconds
- Backup Saves - Every 30 minutes, the game will auto-save your progress
    - There are two backup save files, and the game will alternate between the two names

## Platforms
NGU Idle is available on the following four platforms, with only the first two up-to-date:
- Steam
- Kartridge
- Kongregate (Build 1.220 - 1 patch behind Finale update) - only Mac-compatible platform
- Armor Games (Build 0.423 - 2 years out of date)

NGU Idle saves can be imported to any platform on the same patch or later, but saves cannot be imported into past patches. So you can switch from any platform to Steam/Kartridge, but you cannot go back from Steam/Kartridge to Kongregate or Armor Games. 

Both Steam and Kartridge offer a one-time bonus of 7 free spins for playing on their platform.

There are no known plans for further platforms, updates, or porting to mobile.
