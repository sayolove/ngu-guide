**Welcome to the NGU Idle Guide!**

NGU Idle is an incremental game made by 4G, currently available on Steam and Kartridge.   
With over a year's worth of content, NGU Idle is the top Idle game on Kongregate.

This guide was created by collecting and organizing strategies discussed in the NGU Idle Discord. These strategies are not meant to be speedrun strategies to complete the game as quickly as possible, but aim to provide a path of consistent and relatively optimized progress through the game. While this guide may provide many suggestions on how to play, these are only meant as suggestions. No guide can provide the same insight as critically thinking about the game, realizing where your priorities should be, and figuring out your own best path forward. Best of luck!

## Getting Started

To get started with this theme, check out the `README.md` in your new project directory. It provides documentation on how to use and customize this template for your own project. Keep the README around so that you can always refer back to it as you build.

Found a missing feature that you can't live without? Please suggest it on Discord [(#ideas-and-suggestions channel)](https://astro.build/chat) and even consider adding it yourself on GitHub! Astro is an open source project and contributions from developers like you are how we grow!

Good luck out there, Astronaut. üßë‚ÄçüöÄ
