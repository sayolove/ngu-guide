**Welcome to the NGU Idle Guide!**

NGU Idle is an incremental game made by 4G, currently available on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1147690/NGU_IDLE/) and [Kartridge](https://www.kartridge.com/games/somethingggg/ngu-idle). With over a year's worth of content, NGU Idle is the top Idle game on Kongregate.

This guide was created by collecting and organizing strategies discussed in the [NGU Idle Discord](https://discord.com/invite/5revMxD). These strategies are not meant to be speedrun strategies to complete the game as quickly as possible, but aim to provide a path of consistent and relatively optimized progress through the game. While this guide may provide many suggestions on how to play, these are only meant as suggestions. No guide can provide the same insight as critically thinking about the game, realizing where your priorities should be, and figuring out your own best path forward. Best of luck!

This guide was initally published as a Google Doc: [NGU Idle Guide by sayo](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N-tt-Zy4UTREHzduwtW6kT7XR73gbA9yNSlAkETdhZ0/edit?usp=sharing)

## Getting Started

This guide is split into sections: Chapters, Mechanics, Guides, Reference Lists, and Secrets & Spoilers
- Chapters form the bulk of the guide, providing suggestions on how to progress through the game. Chapters cover the basic of each mechanic and provides information relevant to your Adventure progression.
- Mechanics provides a more detailed page on each game mechanic, with relevant tips and data.
- Guides provide smaller mini-guides for specific situations
- Reference Lists can be used to quickly reference stats and unlocks for different features
- Secrets & Spoilers provides solutions to puzzles and secrets

Although the game has plenty of content and mechanics to explore, I would highly suggest joining the Discord and saying hello in your respective progression chat. The game is a lot more enjoyable when you have the social aspect of playing alongside other players and being able to compare progress, try different strategies, and make some friends along the way :unsmith:

If you’re starting your playthrough, you can head over to [Chapter 1](/ngu-guide/chapters/chapter-1) to get started.
