**Welcome to the NGU Idle Guide!**

NGU Idle is an incremental game made by 4G, currently available on Steam and Kartridge. With over a year's worth of content, NGU Idle is the top Idle game on Kongregate.

This guide was created by collecting and organizing strategies discussed in the NGU Idle Discord. These strategies are not meant to be speedrun strategies to complete the game as quickly as possible, but aim to provide a path of consistent and relatively optimized progress through the game. While this guide may provide many suggestions on how to play, these are only meant as suggestions. No guide can provide the same insight as critically thinking about the game, realizing where your priorities should be, and figuring out your own best path forward. Best of luck!

This guide was initally published as a Google Doc: [NGU Idle Guide by sayo](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N-tt-Zy4UTREHzduwtW6kT7XR73gbA9yNSlAkETdhZ0/edit?usp=sharing)

## Getting Started

This guide is split into three sections: Progression Chats, Game Mechanics, and the Appendix
Progression chats split the game into sections, based on your Adventure progress. These chats cover the basic mechanics and approach you should take based on where you are
Each chat contains new information first, then covers specific Adventure zones after
Game Mechanics will explain each feature in detail, with relevant tips and information
The Appendix covers additional information that didn’t fit in the other sections, including Secrets / Spoilers, Mini-Guides, and Reference Lists / Tables

Although the game has plenty of content and mechanics to explore, I would highly suggest joining the Discord and saying hello in your respective progression chat. The game is a lot more enjoyable when you have the social aspect of playing alongside other players and being able to compare progress, try different strategies, and make some friends along the way :unsmith:

If you’re starting your playthrough, you can head over to Chat 1 to get started.

I spent the bulk of 2.5 months writing most of the content in this guide, as well as editing and coordinating contributions from co-writers and beta readers. I quit my job to pursue this little passion project, so if you appreciate all the content and feel a little generous, I’m accepting tips on Ko-fi. Thank you kindly!
