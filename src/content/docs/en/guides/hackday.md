Endorm Solor’s quick hackday planning guide

![Endorm Solor Hackday Guide](/ngu-guide/hackday.png)

*Thanks to CBD for his original hackday guide that this guide is mostly based on*

1. Make sure all of your gear in [Gear Optimizer](https://gmiclotte.github.io/gear-optimizer) is updated
    - If any of your gear isn’t boosted, boost it before continuing
2. Save your currently equipped gear as a loadout in Gear Optimizer
3. Set your gear priority to Hacks/Infinity and optimize
    - For your very first Hackday (post-Typo), you might not have enough Hack items to fill all your accessory slots. You can fill the remaining slots with Respawn items.
4. Save this loadout in a new loadout slot in Gear Optimizer
5. Go to the Hacks tab in GO. Input your Total R3 stats. Input hack speed but divide it by 100. Check the box that says lock and set the time to 1440 minutes (1 day).
    - Hack Speed can be found in Info n Stuff > Stat Breakdowns > Misc > Total Hack Speed
    - Divide by 100 as it’s expressed as a % in-game, but wanted as a decimal for GO
    - If you’re using scientific/engineering notation, you can decrease the exponent by 2
6. Set the mode to “Level Target” and check the advanced modifiers box.
7. In the “current loadout” box select the loadout that you saved of the gear you’re currently wearing in game. In the “dedicated loadout” box select the hack loadout that you saved. 
8. Check blue heart if you have it maxed. Check the dedicated beta/delta potion boxes. Check the current beta/delta potion boxes if you currently have those R3 potions active.
9. Input your current hack values and your milestone reducers.
10. Begin adding milestones using the ‘+’ button in the targets column until the time for each hack is within the following time ranges: *(Thanks to CecilPL for providing these times)*
    - 8-12h Adventure
    - 4-6h QP / PP / EXP
    - 1h NGUs
    - 30m Drop / Blood / Daycare
    - 1h wishes (if this is the hackday after typo snipe, do not do wish hack)
    - ~15m everything else
    - Add hack hack milestones until the “Min total” is as low as possible
11. Adjust times until your min total is slightly above 24 hours. 25-26 hours is a nice sweet spot. If you’re looking to add some more milestones to your hackday, I recommend starting if you can add any Adv/QP/EXP/PP milestones without making the time go too high.
    - Check if you can add another hack hack milestone after adding other milestones.
12. If you’re comfortable with your hackday, you’re ready to begin! If you’re not comfortable with your hackday, feel free to go to the discord and post a pic of it and people there will be glad to help you with it. Feel free to ping Jetski (@Jetski#0001) for help if you want. 

Important things to remember when you do your hackday:
- Begin with Hack Hack. 
- Use your R3 beta potion when you begin the hackday
- Wait to use the delta potion until your R3 is capped
- Try not to close the game during the hackday. Advance R3 / Delta potions do not work offline so it will mess up your targets. 
- Boost all of your hack gear before beginning the hackday.
