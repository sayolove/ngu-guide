UUG, The Unmentionable has a special Titan skill that renders him invincible after his first attack and exponential power growth. This Titan skill can be disabled by solving a puzzle.

Here are some hints for the puzzle, each giving more information than the last:
1. Kill Boss 100 in your current rebirth
2. Try fighting T4 in Adventure. You’ll die quickly, take note of the text in the battle log
3. Try looking for that name in the Bestiary (in Adventure)
4. It’s not listed as an enemy name, it’s in one of the descriptions
5. Found the correct enemy? Farm that enemy in the zone where he appears in Adventure
6. Continue farming the enemy until you’ve maxed it, equip it while fighting T4

Answer: UUG, The Unmentionable mentions Droop, which is the name of the Goblin from the Forest. Having Boss 100 defeated in a rebirth will unlock a super rare drop from the Goblin, the Ring of Apathy, an accessory with base drop chance 0.8%. Once you have obtained one, the drop will always be unlocked regardless of the highest boss killed that rebirth. The Ring of Apathy must be maxed and equipped while fighting T4 to disable the titan skill.

Specifically, having any level of Ring of Apathy (RoA) equipped will disable invincibility, while T4’s power growth is equivalent to (2 - 0.01 * RoA Level)x per attack, with no growth at Level 100. This means that it’s possible to kill T4 with a lower level RoA if the player has enough stats. However, it is a requirement to have maxed RoA to enable T4 AK, so it is suggested to max RoA anyways.

## Micro-CBlock Reasoning

Previously, the Basic Challenges were suggested post-T4 AK in Mini-CBlock, so you could knock out some other challenges that want 500 NGU PAWG levels. However, this made reaching Mega/T4 take a few days, during which time you’d also have to farm RoA. The reasoning for Micro was that the Basic Challenges don’t need NGU levels to complete and if you complete Micro before the T4 LRB, then you can get a headstart on farming RoA during challenges, where you can’t farm the furthest adventure zones anyways. Getting the adventure stats earlier helps speed up the T4 LRB, and the time it takes to complete the basics are roughly the same before or after T4 anyways.
