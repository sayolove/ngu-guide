Added in an April Fools update (Build v0.371), The Lonely Flubber is a secret item that drops in the Tutorial Zone, with its DC only affected by your current rebirth’s highest defeated boss.

- You must have defeated Boss 59 in your current RB to unlock The Lonely Flubber drop
- At Boss 59, you have a 0.82% DC, scaling up linearly up to 100% at Boss 300
- The Lonely Flubber is an accessory, dropping at Level 10

## Triple Flubber

The Lonely Flubber has no stats at all, making it useless when it’s equipped. However, a max The Lonely Flubber can be transformed to The Triple Flubber, which has a single special stat: Respawn (base value: 2%, can be boosted up to 4% at Level 0, 8% at Level 100)

- Maxing The Triple Flubber grants a set bonus of 30k AP

Suggested time to farm:
- Triple Flubber is not used as a respawn item until Evil, but since the DC is based on current boss defeated, it’s recommended to farm a Max Triple Flubber at Boss 300 right before Evil
- It can be appealing to farm Triple Flubber earlier for 30k AP, some players opt to max it for an early Improved Loot Filter or Yellow Heart
    - If you farm it early, note that you probably will not use the item during Normal, it will occupy an inventory slot until Evil
