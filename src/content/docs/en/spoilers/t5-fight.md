Walderp’s main mechanic is Walderp Says (Simon Says). Every 5 attacks (18 seconds), Walderp will give a command:
- If he says ‘WALDERP SAYS’, you must quickly use the attack he says
- If he does not say ‘WALDERP SAYS’, you must use a different attack
    - Not using an attack is considered failure
- Failing either type of command will allow Walderp to nuke you with a huge attack
    - This attack can be blocked with sufficiently high Block AT levels. At least 90%

## Strategy

You want to make sure that all four attack types (Regular, Strong, Piercing, Ultimate) are available when Walderp calls his command
- After Walderp does his command, use your skills with long cooldowns immediately (Piercing / Ultimate Attack), so you can use their damage output but get them back in time for the next command
- As it gets closer to the next command, spam only Regular Attack since it has a short cooldown.

## Post-Fight

After killing one of the first four forms, Walderp will hide in a random menu
- You must find (and click) Walderp to unlock the next form
- Every 3 minutes, Walderp moves to a new location and is fully invisible
    - Over the 3 minutes, Walderp will become more visible, until disappearing
- If you do not find Walderp, the next form of Walderp will not be available to kill
    - The timer for the next form’s spawn starts after clicking on Walderp
