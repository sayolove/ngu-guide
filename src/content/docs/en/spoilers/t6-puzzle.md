1. Defeat Boss 132 to unlock THE BEAST’s Adventure zone
2. Enter THE BEAST’s Adventure zone and defeat the Skeleton Guardian
    - The Skeleton Guardian will drop a ‘Crumpled Note’:
```
To release the power of THE BEAST, heed these words carefully:

First, thou must defeat the one whose name must not be uttered, with the most sacred level of apathy.

Next, thou must slay the World Tree wielding a shadow of its own strength.

Third, thou must cruelly mock the salaryman, causing his demise by that which he most treasures, and nothing more.

Finally, thou must run naked into infinite majesty of the tower for no real reason, starting from the lowest bowels to the highest heights.

Only when these four quests ye have completed, and the clues arranged from end to beginning, will thou know when seal away thine own power, which will awaken THE BEAST.
```
3. Defeat UUG, the Unmentionable (T4) while wearing a Level 69 Ring of Apathy. Grants ‘The First Clue’
4. Defeat Grand Corrupted Tree (T2) while using A Stick. Grants ‘The Second Clue’
5. Defeat Jake from Accounting (T3) wearing no gear except for the Stapler. Grants ‘The Third Clue’
6. Take all your gear off, climb the ITOPOD from Floor 0 to Floor 101. Grants ‘The Last Clue’
7. Assemble all the clues together in reverse order and rebirth at that time

Answer: After obtaining all four clues, rebirth between 43:09 and 43:29. After rebirthing at that time, THE BEAST will be awakened and can be fought normally.
